	      <p><i>vice</i> is (now) an air traffic control simulator, focused on TRACON.
                Its goal is to provide a training experience similar to a VATSIM sweatbox with an instructor, 
                just without the instructor, making it possible to better
                prepare for sweatboxes and to practice vectoring and traffic handling techniques without being on the network.
                It presents a STARS-like interface, but with simulated traffic and other controllers.
              </p>
              <p><i>vice</i> currently supports departure and arrival control
                scenarios in the N90 TRACON (KEWR, KJFK and KPHL, Liberty Departure) and
                in the F11 TRACON (KMCO, KSFB, KISM, KORL...).
                Adding scenarios at more airports is a matter of writing JSON configuration files that describe them;
                see <a href="#section-facility-engineering">below</a> for documentation about how scenarios are described
                and please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/y993vgQxhY">vice discord</a> if you'd like to contribute!
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a short <a href="https://youtu.be/MNFpFaT1k7s">video overview</a> that gives a tour of <i>vice</i>.
              </p>

	  <section class="docs-intro" id="started">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The radar client interface that <i>vice</i> provides is based on STARS, by way of reimplementing most of the functionality in 
              <a href="https://vstars.rosscarlson.dev">vSTARS</a>. In general, all of the keyboard and menu commands that are available in vSTARS
              are available in <i>vice</i> (though quicklook and CRDA are not yet implemented).  See the <a href="https://vstars.rosscarlson.dev/Assets/Files/vSTARS%20Command%20Reference.pdf">vSTARS Command Reference</a> for a summary of the commands supported.
              The appearance of <i>vice</i> can be similarly configured using the DCB buttons at the top of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <i>vice</i> is launched, a window is shown for configuring the simulation.
              A number of scenarios are available, some departure-only and
              some including both departures and arrivals.
              Here is the window for KJFK:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="config.jpg" srcset="config-2x.jpg 2x" width="517" height="593" class="img-fluid" alt="configuration dialog box">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              Scenarios may offer one or more control positions; KJFK offers both approach and departure.
              Once a control position is chosen, you can choose a specific runway configuration.
              </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the total number of aircraft to launch in the simulation, it is possible to set the average departure rate (ADR)
              for all of the airports that may have departures in the scenario as well as the average arrival rate (AAR) for all of the
              active arrival airports.
              (Here, we have the option of also having arrivals to Republic,
              KFRG, a JFK satellite airport.)
              Both of these rates are specified in terms of aircraft per hour, so an ADR of 30 corresponds to an aircraft  departing
              every two minutes (on average).
              If you'd like an arrival-only scenario, for example, just set all of the departure rates to zero.
              The "Sequencing challenge" slider controls how challenging the departure sequence is&mdash;the higher it is, the more likely it is
              that successive departures will be to the same gate or to the same fix.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you have configured the simulation, click "Ok" and you will have a STARS scope and flight strip window to work with.
              Use the usual STARS commands as appropriate (to initiate track, accept handoffs, handoff to other controllers, etc.),
              and the additional <a href="#commands">ATC commands below</a> to issue control commands to aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the simulation, the "Settings" menu offers a few options, including pausing and resuming.
              If "Restart..." is selected, the configuration window is shown again, allowing a new scenario to be selected.
              Finally, "Settings..." allows configuring a number of details, including the flight strips shown at the right and
              in which situations sounds are played (and which sounds to play for them.)
              </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>To adjust the amount of space used for flight strips, right click the line separating the flight strips from the
              radar window and drag left or right with your mouse.

            <p>In order to issue control commands to aircraft, type the appropriate command from the table below
              and click on an aircraft's track. After you issue a command, the virtual pilot's readback is shown at the top of the window.
              The aircraft will then start following that instruction, to the best of its abilities.
              Unlike VATSIM, the pilots will always do exactly what you tell them to.
            </p>
            <p>If you'd like to issue multiple commands to an aircraft,
              enter the commands one after another with a space between them and
              then click on the appropriate aircraft.

            <p>
              <i>vice</i> is able to indicate when aircraft are outside of the departure or approach airspace,
              if it has information about the airspace boundaries.
              (This information is currently only available for KPHL.)
              If an aircraft is outside of its assigned airspace, a red "AS" error will be printed at the
              top of its datablock, as shown below.
              The valid altitudes for the aircraft are shown as well, if there are any valid altitudes
              at its current location.
              For example, the aircraft below is at 5,000' but should be between 10,000' and 12,000' (or should be at a different location!)
            </p>

            <p>
              Two commands are available to draw the boundaries and altitude ranges of the departure and approach airspace.
              (Note that the placement of the drawn altitude labels is not always ideal.)

              You control both departures and arrivals for KMCO, KSFB, KISM, and KORL and
              departures for KMLB.

            <p>
              Scenarios are available for all of the usual JFK configurations.
              It is also possible to include
              KFRG arrivals, KLGA departures to the Southwest and to water gates, and KISP departures
              to the North gate, if desired.
              The "intra-TRACON" arrivals are flights from nearby
              airports that don't arrive via STARS but are instead inbound from COL, ZIGGI, and DPK.

            <h3>KPHL</h3>

            <p><i>vice</i> offers scenarios at KPHL for both West and East ops.
              There is also a "KPHL 27R Final" scenario that has flows of traffic from the
              North and South that need to be merged in the approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with the other airports, the identifiers used for the "expect approach" and "cleared approach"
              commands correspond to the scratchpad labels used at KPHL.
              For now only the ILS approaches are available (except for runway 35, where there is no localizer.)
              They are summarized for reference below:

            <section class="docs-intro">
              <p>All of the configuration of <i>vice</i> is via JSON-formatted files.
                Extending <i>vice</i> to include more airports or additional scenarios is a matter
                of generating additional JSON that provides the necessary information.
              </p>
              <p>In the following, the use of terms like "element", "object", "member", "array", etc.,
                correspond to their use in the JSON specification.  See <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">this page</a> for reference.
                </p>
              <p>Scenarios are directly included in <i>vice</i> when a release is made.
                See the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/scenarios"><tt>scenarios/</tt> directory</a> in the 
                  vice source code for the scenarios that are currently available and the
                <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/videomaps"><tt>videomaps/</tt> directory</a> for
                the video map definitions.
                Files in those directories with names ending with a "zst" suffix have been compressed using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">zstandard</a>;
                in order to examine their contents, you'll want to install zstandard or another decompression program that supports that
                format.
              </p>
              <p>When developing scenarios, you might make a copy of an existing scenario's JSON file and modify it in order to add more configurations,
                or you or might specify completely new scenario and video map files if you're working on support for a new TRACON.
                While you're doing this, there are two ways to point <i>vice</i> at the file you're working on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Via the command-line: if you open a command prompt and run <i>vice</i> from the command line,
                  there are two options make it possible to specify additional files for testing:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The <tt>-scenario</tt> command line option takes a single filename.
                      The scenario specified file is loaded at startup time; if it has the same name as an existing scenario, it replaces
                      that scenario's definition.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a similar manner, the <tt>-videomap</tt> command line option also takes a single filename that specifies a file
                      with video map definitions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Alternatively, select the "Settings..." menu item in <i>vice</i> and then expand the "Developer" section.
                  You can select a scenario file and or a video map file to use.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>When you're working on a new scenario, you may omit the "video_map_file" specifier in its JSON file.
                In this case, <i>vice</i> will automatically use the video map file you specified via <tt>-videomap</tt>
                or via the UI.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Specifying Locations</h2>

            <p>Throughout the <i>vice</i> configuration files, it's often necessary to specify various locations on the Earth.
              <i>vice</i> has a built-in database of all of the airports, VORs, NDBs, and fixes in the United States (courtesy of the FAA),
              which allows using these directly for specifying locations.  Locations can also be specified via
              latitude-longitude positions, given as strings. For convenience, multiple latitude-longitude formats are supported.

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-routes">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Routes</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> uses a custom syntax for specifying the routes of aircraft, both for arrivals and departures.
              In addition to the lateral positions along the route, it is possibly to specify speed and altitude restrictions, handoff points,
              and headings to fly.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example route from a JFK departure. The first two waypoints are custom fixes at the start and end of the KJFK 31L runway,
              specified via the "fixes" object in the <a href="#fe-scenario-groups">scenario group</a>, while the next three are standard
              fixes.  The "#223" at the end leaves the aircraft on a 223 heading as it departs RNGRR.  It will maintain that heading until it
              is further vectored by the controller.  If there's are further fixes after such a heading, the aircraft may be sent direct to one of
              those fixes by the controller.
            <pre>
  "_JFK_31L _JFK_13R SKORR METSS RNGRR #223"
            </pre>
            <p>
              Altitude and speed restrictions can be specified at fixes.  Here's an example from a JFK arrival.  The "@a3000" after CATOD specifies
              a 3,000' altitude restriction at the crossing and "@s210" specifies a 210 kts speed restriction. 
              </p>
            <pre>
  "PZULU CATOD@a3000@s210 IGIDE@a1900 _JFK_31R@a50",
            </pre>
            <p>Finally, a handoff point can be specified using a single "@".  When an aircraft reaches that point in the route, it is
              handed off from the virtual controller to the user.
              Here is an example from the CAMRN4 arrival at KJFK.
              Immediately after the aircraft reaches KARRS it will be handed off from the virtual controller that is tracking it (NY_CTR in this case)
              to the user's control position.  The aircraft will continue to CAMRN and then fly a 041 heading until the user gives
              it vectors.
            </p>
            <pre>
  "N039.46.43.120,W074.03.15.529 KARRS @ CAMRN #41"
            </pre>

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-airlines-aircraft">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Airlines and Aircraft</h2>

            <p>Both departures and arrivals need to know about which airlines fly their routes and which aircraft they use for them.
              Airlines are specified via their ICAO strings (e.g., AAL for American Airlines).  See the file
              <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/blob/master/resources/openscope-airlines.json">openscope-airlines.json</a>
              for the database of possible airlines.
              In that file, each airline may have one or more aircraft fleets specified, in its "fleets" member.
              If no fleet is specified, <i>vice</i> randomly chooses an aircraft type from the "default" fleet, but if
              a particular fleet's aircraft is a better match to a route, you may want to use it.
              For example, AAL's "long" fleet would be a good choice for trans-Atlantic flights.
            </p>
            <p>For reference, the available types of aircraft and their performance characteristics are available in the
              <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/blob/master/resources/openscope-aircraft.json">openscope-aircraft.json</a>
              file.
            </p>
            <p>As is probably obvious, both of these databases are by way of <a href="https://github.com/openscope/openscope">openScope</a>,

            <p>Video maps are specified separately from the rest of the configuration since they require fairly large files and are not normally edited by hand.
              Video map files are simply JSON files with a series of members, each one of which stores an array of strings giving latitude-longitude positions.
              Each successive pair of positions specifies a line to be draw when rendering the video map.

              a control position (departure, approach, etc.), and airport configurations&mdash;the runways that are active at each

            <p>The airports in a scenario group are specified via the "airports" member of the scenario group.
              Each airports is a separate member, named according to the airport's ICAO code (e.g., "KJFK").
              The airport object then has the following member variables:

                  Each approach is then defined by the following members:

                    <li>"full_name": a string giving the full name of the approach (e.g., "RNAV Z Runway 13L")</li>

            <p>There are two pieces for specifying departures: their initial route leaving the airport, which depends on the active departure runway,
              and their subsequent route out of the TRACON, which does not. These two parts are specified separately.</p>
            <p>The "departure_routes" object gives the initial routing for departures, based both on the runway they are departing as well
              as their exit fix.  Here is an excerpt from the KJFK departure routes:
              </p>
            <pre>
  "departure_routes": {
    "13R": {
      "ARD,DIXIE,RBV,WHITE": {
        "cleared_altitude": 5000,
        "route": "JFK5",
        "waypoints": "_JFK_13R _JFK_31L #185"
      },
      ...
            </pre>
            <p>The members of "departure_routes" are strings identifying the departure runway; each departure runway's routes
              are then represented by an object with one or more members that specify comma-separated lists of exit fixes.
              (Thus, the specification above applies to departures with exit ARD, DIXIE, RBV, or WHITE, departing runway 13R.)
              The departure route specification has three members:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>"cleared_altitude": the initial altitude that aircraft are cleared to</li>
                <li>"route": a string naming the route that is added to the start of aircraft's route as shown in flight strips, etc.
                <li>"waypoints": the initial series of waypoints that the aircraft follows. (Here, the first two are custom fixes specified
                  at the ends of the runway.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              On departure the aircraft will fly the specified waypoints and then the waypoints specified in the route
              to its destination. In this case, aircraft will remain on a 185 heading until vectored by the controller
              (as explained in <a href="#fe-routes">Routes</a>, above.)
            </p>

            <p>The other half of specifying departures is the array of objects stored in "departures". Each one describes a departure
              to a particular destination. Here is a KJFK departure to Paris Charles de Gaulle:
            </p>
            <pre>
    {
      "airlines": [
        {
          "fleet": "long",
          "icao": "AFR"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "LPFG",
      "exit": "HAPIE",
      "route": "HAPIE YAHOO WHALE N251A JOOPY NATZ MALOT NATZ GISTI LESLU M142 LND N160 NAKID M25 ANNET UM25 UVSUV UM25 INGOR UM25 LUKIP LUKIP9E"
    },
  ...
            </pre>
            <p>Four things must be specified with each departure:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"airlines": The airlines that fly the route and which part of their fleet of aircraft is used; see <a href="#fe-airlines-aircraft">airlines
                    and aircraft</a> below for more information</li>
                <li>"destination": the ICAO airport code for the destination. This is only used in flight strips and for the aircraft's datablock on the
                  radar scope; it does not affect its routing.</li>
                <li>"exit": the exit fix for the departure. In conjunction with the departure runway, this is used to determine the aircraft's
                  route leaving the airport using "departure_routes".</li>
                <li>"route": the aircraft's route to the destination. This is mostly used so that flight strips have plausible routes, though
                  <i>vice</i> does its best to have the aircraft follow the given route after it reaches the exit fix.
              </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Arrivals</h2>

            <p>Arrivals are specified via the "arrival_groups" variable, which allows specifying one or more STARs that
              bring aircraft to the TRACON.  Members of "arrival_groups" give the names of arrival groups; each one stores
              an array of one or more arrival objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because arrival rates are specified per-arrival group rather than per-STAR,
              <i>vice</i> can simulate center controllers sequencing multiple STARs into a single arrival flow rather than
              spawning arrivals on two STARs that follow nearby routes and thus should be sequences.
            </p>
            <p>Each object stored in an "arrival_groups" array corresponds to a STAR.
              These objects have the following members:

            <p>STARs are sometimes able to deliver aircraft to multiple airports. Therefore, the "airlines" member
              is an object with airport names as members.  Each of the airports is associated with an array of objects
              that specify departure airports, airlines, and (optionally) airline fleets.  Here is an excerpt from the
              CAMRN4 arrival group at KJFK:
            </p>
            <pre>
  "airlines": {
    "KFRG": [
      {
        "airport": "KDCA",
        "icao": "EJA"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "KJFK": [
      {
        "airport": "MMMY",
        "fleet": "long",
        "icao": "AMX"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
            </pre>
            <p>We can see that CAMRN4 applies to both the KFRG and KJFK airports, though with different airlines
              and different departure airports for the arrivals. The specified departure airports (here, KDCA and MMMY)
              are only used so that flight strips and data blocks on the scope are realistic, but the specified airlines
              are used to select the type of aircraft from their fleets.  As elsewhere, a value for "fleet" may be specified
              to limit which types of aircraft may be chosen.
            </p>

            <p>The "runway_waypoints" member can be used for STARs that have different routes depending on the runway.
              When the user instructs the aircraft to expect a particular approach then the corresponding waypoints are
              added to its route. As an example, here are some of the entries for the JIIMS3 arrival at KPHL:
            </p>
            <pre>
  "runway_waypoints": {
    "27R": "HEKMN N039.27.43.645,W074.56.38.400 @ JIIMS@a8000 BEELZ WOJIK@s190 PSOUT #87",
    "35": "HEKMN N039.27.43.645,W074.56.38.400 @ JIIMS@a8000 SNEDE",

            <h2 class="section-heading">Airspace</h2>

            <p>Airspace volumes may optionally be specified using the "airspace" object in the scenario group.
              These volumes may be assigned to controllers in scenarios, in which case <i>vice</i> will show an
              alert when aircraft are outside of the controller's airspace.  The airspace object has two members: 
            </p>
            <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Element</th>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>"boundaries"</td>
                <td>Object</td>
                <td>Defines all of the airports that are included in the scenarios. See the <a href="#fe-airports">airports section</a> for details.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>"volumes"</td>
                <td>Object</td>
                <td>Defines all of the airports that are included in the scenarios. See the <a href="#fe-airports">airports section</a> for details.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Each member in "boundaries" names a polyline of one or more line segments.  Polylines are specified by arrays of locations.
              The first and second points specify the first line, the second and third points specify the second line, and so forth.
              Here is an example from the KPHL airspace:
              </p>
<pre>
  "PHL_DQO27_33": [
    "N039.21.58.949,W075.28.55.977",
    "N039.25.56.240,W075.29.47.255",
    "N039.26.20.204,W075.27.28.196",
    "N039.22.24.699,W075.26.48.535",
    "N039.21.58.949,W075.28.55.977"
  ]
</pre>
            <p>Note that the first point and the last point are at the same location and thus, "PHL_DQO27_33" is a closed polygon.
              Airspace boundaries do not have to be polygons like this; because boundaries are generally shared between different
              volumes of airspace, it's often useful to define boundaries just as polylines and to assemble multiple boundaries
              to define the lateral extent of a volume of airspace.
            </p>
            <p>Given the boundaries, "volumes" specifies full 3D volumes of airspace.  Airspace volumes have three members; "boundaries"
              is an array of strings that names the boundaries that give the airspace's lateral extent, and "lower" and "upper" specify the
              altitude range of the airspace.  Here is an example from KPHL that uses the boundary defined above:
              </p>
            <pre>
  "PHL_DU_APP27": [
    {
      "boundaries": [
        "PHL_DQO27_33"
      ],
      "lower": 5000,
      "upper": 6000
