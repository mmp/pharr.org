	    <section class="docs-intro">
	      <p><i>vice</i> is an air traffic control simulator, focused on TRACON.
                Its goal is to provide a training experience similar to a VATSIM sweatbox with an instructor, 
                just without the instructor, making it possible to better
                prepare for sweatboxes and to practice vectoring and traffic handling techniques without being on the network.
                It presents a STARS-like interface, but with simulated traffic and other controllers.
              </p>
              <p><i>vice</i> supports departure and arrival control
                scenarios in a number of TRACONs: A80 (ATL), A90 (BOS), C90 (ORD, MDW), F11 (JAX, MCO, SFB, ISM, ORL), 
                N90 (EWR, JFK, LGA, FRG, ISP, HVN),
                as well as the ABE, CLE, CLT, DAB, JAX, and PHL ATCT/TRACONs.
                New scenarios are regularly added.
                Adding scenarios at more airports is a matter of writing JSON configuration files that describe them;
                see <a href="#section-facility-engineering">below</a> for documentation about how scenarios are described
                and please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/y993vgQxhY"><i>vice</i> discord</a> if you'd like to contribute!
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a short <a href="https://youtu.be/MNFpFaT1k7s">video overview</a> that gives a tour of <i>vice</i>. (Note: this video was recorded with an older version of <i>vice</i>, so some details are different in the latest version.)
              </p>

	  <section class="docs-section" id="started">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The radar client interface that <i>vice</i> provides is based on STARS.
              For familiarity to VATSIM controllers, <i>vice</i> generally follows the keyboard command scheme implemented
              in <a href="https://vstars.rosscarlson.dev">vSTARS</a>; see
              the discussion of <a href="#stars"><i>vice</i>'s STARS
              emulation</a> below for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first time you launch <i>vice</i>, a window is shown for configuring the simulation.
              (After the first time, the window can be brought up by clicking the "replay" button in the menubar: <i class="fas fa-redo"></i>.)
              A number of scenarios are available, some departure-only and
              some including both departures and arrivals.
              Here is the configuration window for LGA:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="config.jpg" srcset="config-2x.jpg 2x" width="515" height="689" class="img-fluid" alt="configuration dialog box">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              (Each scenario usually offers multiple runway configurations.)
            </p>
            <p>
              In the configuration window, you can set the average departure rate (ADR)
              for all of the airports that may have departures in the scenario as well as the average arrival rate (AAR) for all of the
              arrival airports.
              (The LGA scenario only includes Laguardia Airport, though other scenarios include both a primary airport as well as satellites.)
              Both of these rates are specified in terms of aircraft per hour, so an ADR of 30 corresponds to one aircraft departing
              every two minutes (on average).
              If you'd like an arrival-only scenario, for example, just set all of the departure rates to zero.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "Sequencing challenge" slider controls how challenging the departure sequence is&mdash;the higher it is, the more likely it is
              that successive departures will be to the same gate or to the same fix.
              For arrivals, the "Go around probability" slider allows setting the probability that each arrival goes around.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you have configured the simulation, click "Ok" and you will have a STARS scope and flight strip window to work with.
              Use the usual STARS commands as appropriate (to initiate track, accept handoffs, handoff to other controllers, etc.),
              and the additional <a href="#commands">ATC commands below</a> to issue control commands to aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the simulation starts, <i>vice</i> also displays a small window listing the available approaches.
              For this LGA scenario, there is just one approach, though other scenarios may have multiple runways and or multiple airports active.
              The approach code&mdash;here, "I22"&mdash; is used in <i>vice</i>'s aircraft control commands like "expect approach"
              and "cleared approach".
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="approaches.jpg" srcset="approaches-2x.jpg 2x" width="246" height="91" class="img-fluid" alt="approach list">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>To free up space, you can close this window by clicking on the "X" in the upper right corner.
              Clicking on the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button in the menubar will show
              the window again.
            </p>
            <p>To adjust the amount of space used for flight strips, right click the line separating the flight strips from the
              radar window and drag left or right with your mouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              A number of buttons are available in the menu bar at the top of the window:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-pause-circle"></i> / <i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i>: pause or resume the simulation.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-redo"></i>: opens the window to select a new scenario and set its parameters.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>: open a window that allows changing various settings. The most useful one is the simulation rate: you can speed up time during slow times or to increase the challenge.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i>: show the window that lists the available approaches.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>: open a window with controls for launching aircraft, either automatically or manually.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-book"></i>: open this webpage to review <i>vice</i>'s documentation.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>: display information about the version of <i>vice</i> you have installed.</li>
                <li> <i class="fab fa-discord"></i>: join the <i>vice</i> Discord.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              When you exit <i>vice</i>, it remembers everything going on&mdash;all of the aircraft in flight, the instructions they have been given, etc.
              The next time you launch <i>vice</i>, it loads all of that back in and you can continue where you left off.
              If you'd like to start something new, just click <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> and configure a new simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <i>vice</i> is paused, you can hover the mouse above a radar track to see information about the instructions the aircraft has been given so far&mdash;for example, altitude and speed assignments, whether it has been sent direct to a fix, the approach it has been assigned, etc.  An example is shown below.  This information is especially useful when resuming a <i>vice</i> session after you have been away from it for a while.
              </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Launching Aircraft</h2>
            <p>When a new scenario starts, <i>vice</i> automatically launches new departures and arrivals based on the
              departure and arrival rates set in the "New Simulation" window.
              During a simulation, clicking on the departing plane icon in the menubar <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>
              opens a window that allows more control over aircraft launches.
              (Note that when <i>vice</i> is used with multiple controllers in the same simulation, then only one controller
              may have this window open at a time.)
            </p>
            <p>The rates for automatic launches can be adjusted in this window. Alternatively, aircraft can be launched manually.  If manual launches are selected,
              the window shows all of the available departure runways and exits as
              well as all of the arrivals, as shown below. Clicking the aircraft icon for a departure or arrival
              causes the aircraft shown to be launched.  If you'd like a different aircraft for the
              next launch (for example, to have a heavy aircraft), click the redo icon <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> until you're happy with the selection.
              The window also shows the elapsed time since the launch of each type as well as how many
              miles in trail (MIT) there would be if the next aircraft was launched.
              To clear out all of the current aircraft and restart, click the trash icon:
<i class="fas fa-trash"></i>.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Multiple Controllers</h2>

            <p>With <i>vice</i> you can also have multiple controllers working aircraft together.
              Select "Create multi-controller" in the "New Simulation" window and
              you can select a scenario and set its parameters in more or less the same way
              that you do with a single controller.
              Here is the top part of the multi-controller configuration window;
             all of the settings that are the same as for single-controller aren't shown.

            <p>
              Each multi-controller simulation has a name associated with it;
              <i>vice</i> chooses a random one by default (above, it's "following-nature").
              You're welcome to choose a different name if you prefer.
              These names can be used so that you can tell other people which
              simulation to choose in order to join you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selecting "Join multi-controller" shows a list of the simulations
              that are currently available, including how many controllers
              are signed into each one.
              Note that the simulation names are shown in the first column.
              After selecting one, you can choose one of the available control
              positions and join.
              <i>vice</i> also allows you to join a simulation as an observer,
              in which case you have no control capabilities.

            <p>In order to issue control commands to aircraft, type the appropriate command from the table below

              The aircraft will then start following that instruction, to the best of its abilities.
              Unlike VATSIM, the pilots will always do exactly what you tell them to.
            </p>
            <p>If you'd like to issue multiple commands to an aircraft,
              enter the commands one after another with a space between them and

            <p>
              <i>vice</i> is able to indicate when aircraft are outside of the departure or approach airspace,
              if it has information about the airspace boundaries.
              (This information is not available at all airports.)
              If an aircraft is outside of its assigned airspace, a red "AS" error will be printed at the
              top of its datablock, as shown below.
              The valid altitudes for the aircraft are shown as well, if there are any valid altitudes
              at its current location.
              For example, the aircraft below is at 5,000' but should be between 10,000' and 12,000' (or should be at a different location!)
            </p>

            <p>
              Two commands are available to draw the boundaries and altitude ranges of the departure and approach airspace.
              (Note that the placement of the drawn altitude labels is not always ideal.)

            <h2 class="section-heading">STARS Emulation</h2>
            <p><i>vice</i> attempts to present a reasonably accurate
            representation of
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Terminal_Automation_Replacement_System">Standard
                Terminal Automation Replacement System</a>.
              Its focus is to provide the STARS functionality that is
            useful for regular TRACON controlling; thus, obscure features like
              military operations area commands are not supported.
              If you are familiar with the actual STARS system, suggestions
            about how to improve <i>vice</i>'s accuracy would be happily accepted! Head on over
            to the <a href="https://discord.gg/y993vgQxhY"><i>vice</i> discord</a>...
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>vice</i> mostly follows the keybindings
              used in <a href="https://vstars.rosscarlson.dev">vSTARS</a>; the 
              <a href="https://vstars.rosscarlson.dev/Assets/Files/vSTARS%20Command%20Reference.pdf">vSTARS
              Command Reference</a> provides a summary.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Differences from vSTARS</h3>
            <p><i>vice</i> supports the following features from STARS that
            are not present in vSTARS:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>vice</i> supports the STARS "dwell" mode, which draws
                the datablock and leaderline of track under the mouse more
                brightly when it is enabled. Dwell mode can be configured
                by choosing "SHIFT" from the main DCB menu and then
                selecting the "DWELL" button, or via the following keyboard
                commands:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>[multifunc] D E</code>: enable dwell mode.</li>
                  <li><code>[multifunc] D L</code>: lock dwell
                  mode&mdash;the selected aircraft remains highlighted
                  even if it or the mouse cursor moves.</li>
                  <li><code>[multifunc] D I</code>: inhibit (disable) dwell mode.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>To quicklook a controller, <i>vice</i> does not
              support entering the controller id and hitting enter to
              toggle quicklook. Rather, the <code>[multifunc] Q [id]</code>
                command must be used.</li>
              <li><i>vice</i> supports the "plus" specifier for quicklook:
                if a plus sign is specified after a controller id
                when enabling quicklook, the datablocks for that controller's tracks will
                be white, not green. (Similarly, <code>ALL+</code> can be
                  specified to quick look all controllers' traffic in this
                way.)</li>
              <li><i>vice</i> allows placing DCB at the top, left, right,
             or bottom of the window using the "DCB TOP", "DCB LEFT", "DCB
             RIGHT", and "DCB BOTTOM" buttons.</li>
              <li><i>vice</i> supports displaying the current weather radar
              for the selected location (though not yet with shading that
              matches STARS.)</li>
              </ul>

                  menu bar to open a window with launch
                  controls. Alternatively, launch rates can be controlled
                  during a session via that same window.</li>
                  <li>Various improvements to the accuracy of the STARS
                    radar scope simulation.</li>
                  <li>Available approaches are now shown by <i>vice</i> at initial
                  connection time and via the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button
                    in the menu bar.</li>
                  <li>Many small bug fixes to aircraft flight modeling.</li>
                  <li>New scenarios and improvements:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added C90, including O'Hare East and West
                        ops, MDW all configs</li>
                      <li>Added CLE TRACON, including final, feeder, and
                        North/South scenarios</li>
                      <li>Added CLT TRACON, North and South configs</li>
                      <li>JAX: added DAB and the TEBOW1 arrival</li>
                      <li>N90: added multi-controller scenarios at JFK and PHL</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

            <h3>0.9.2 (3 July 2023)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed the behavior of *T to better match
                    STARS/vSTARS: the line is now drawn to the mouse
                    position after the first point is selected, without
                    waiting for the second point.</li>
                  <li>Added more checks when loading scenario descriptions;
                    in particular, misspellings and unused JSON objects
                    are detected and an error is issued. This led to
                    numerous small fixes in all of the the scenarios.</li>
                  </ul>

            <h3>0.9.1 (20 June 2023)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals wouldn't obey altitude
                    restrictions in STARs(!).</li>
                  <li>Improved navigation: crossing restrictions beyond any
                    at the immediately upcoming fix are now
                    considered. Aircraft are now much better at starting
                    altitude and speed adjustments in time to meet the
                    crossing restrictions.</li>
                  </ul>

            <h3>0.9.0 (15 June 2023)</h3>
                <ul>
		  <li>All new flight modeling engine supports procedure turns (both racetrack and standard 45/180)
                    and more accurate turns to intercept localizers, etc.  The approaches in the existing scenarios
                    have been updated to include their procedure turns, where appropriate.</li>
                  <li>A number of new <a href="#commands">aircraft control
                      commands</a> have been added:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Cancel speed restrictions</li>
                      <li>Cleared straight in approach</li>
                      <li>Cross <i>fix</i> at <i>altitude</i> and <i>speed</i></li>
                      <li>Depart <i>fix</i> at <i>heading</i></li>
                      <li>Fly present heading</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>When a departure is handed off to a virtual controller, the other controller won't
                    climb it further until after it is clicked by the user to acknowledge the handoff.</li>
                  <li>Fixed very small fonts being used on Windows systems with high-DPI displays</li>
                  <li>Numerous other small fixes and improvements, including in the wind modeling and fixing
                    a case where arrivals would fly faster than the aircraft is capable.</li>
                  <li><i>Facility engineering:</i> In addition to new directives to specify procedure turns,
                    there are a number of changes to how <a href="#fe-routes">routes</a> are specified.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Earlier Releases</h3>

            <section class="docs-intro">
              <p>All of the configuration of <i>vice</i> is via JSON-formatted files.
                Extending <i>vice</i> to include more airports or additional scenarios is a matter
                of generating additional JSON that provides the necessary information.
              </p>
              <p>In the following, the use of terms like "element", "object", "member", "array", etc.,
                correspond to their use in the JSON specification.  See <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">this page</a> for reference.
                </p>
              <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/scenarios"><tt>resources/scenarios/</tt> directory</a> in the 
                  vice source code for the scenarios that are currently available and the
                <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/videomaps"><tt>resources/videomaps/</tt> directory</a> for
                the video map definitions.
                Files in those directories with names ending with a "zst" suffix have been compressed using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">zstandard</a>;
                in order to examine their contents, you'll want to install zstandard or another decompression program that supports that
                format.
              </p>
              <p>When developing scenarios, you might make a copy of an existing scenario's JSON file and modify it in order to add more configurations,
                or you or might specify completely new scenario and video map files if you're working on support for a new TRACON.
                While you're doing this, there are two ways to point <i>vice</i> at the file you're working on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Via the command-line: if you open a command prompt and run <i>vice</i> from the command line,
                  there are two options make it possible to specify additional files for testing:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The <tt>-scenario</tt> command line option takes a single filename.
                      The scenario specified file is loaded at startup time; if it has the same name as an existing scenario, it replaces
                      that scenario's definition.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a similar manner, the <tt>-videomap</tt> command line option also takes a single filename that specifies a file
                      with video map definitions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Alternatively, select the "Settings..." menu item in <i>vice</i> and then expand the "Developer" section.
                  You can select a scenario file and or a video map file to use.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>When you're working on a new scenario, you may omit the "video_map_file" specifier in its JSON file.
                In this case, <i>vice</i> will automatically use the video map file you specified via <tt>-videomap</tt>
                or via the UI.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Specifying Locations</h2>

            <p>Throughout the <i>vice</i> configuration files, it's often necessary to specify various locations on the Earth.
              <i>vice</i> has a built-in database of all of the airports, VORs, NDBs, and fixes in the United States (courtesy of the FAA),
              which allows using these directly for specifying locations.  Locations can also be specified via
              latitude-longitude positions, given as strings. For convenience, multiple latitude-longitude formats are supported.
            </p>

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-routes">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Routes</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> uses a custom syntax for specifying the routes of aircraft, both for arrivals and departures.
              In addition to the lateral positions along the route, it is possibly to specify speed and altitude restrictions, handoff points,
              and headings to fly.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example route from a JFK departure. The first two waypoints are custom fixes at the start and end of the KJFK 31L runway,
              specified via the "fixes" object in the <a href="#fe-scenario-groups">scenario group</a>, while the next three are standard
              fixes.  The "/h223" after "RNGRR" specifies that the aircraft should fly a 223 heading as departing RNGRR.
              It will maintain that heading until it
              is further vectored by the controller.  If there are further fixes after such a heading, the aircraft may be sent direct to one of
              those fixes by the controller.
            <pre>
  "_JFK_31L _JFK_13R SKORR METSS RNGRR/h223"
            </pre>
            <p>A number of items like headings can be specified with a fix:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>/a</code><i>restriction</i>: cross the fix with the specified altitude restriction (with altitudes specified in 100s of feet).
                The following options are available for specifying altitude restrictions:
                <ul>
                  <li><i>low</i><code>-</code><i>high</i>: cross at an altitude between <i>low</i> and <i>high</i>.</li>
                  <li><i>alt</i><code>-</code>: cross at or below <i>alt</i>
                  <li><i>alt</i><code>+</code>: cross at or above <i>alt</i>
                  <li><i>alt</i>: cross at <i>alt</i>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> <code>/h</code><i>heading</i>: depart the fix at specified heading</li>
              <li> <code>/s</code><i>speed</i>: cross the fix at the given speed</li>
              <li> <code>/ho</code>: the aircraft should be handed off from the virtual controller to the user when it departs the fix</li>              
            </ul>
            <p>For approach fixes that have procedure turns, a number of additional items can be specified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>/hilpt</code>: there is a hold in lieu of procedure turn (i.e., a racetrack procedure turn) associated with the fix.
                The default is right turns and a 1 minute limit for ILS approaches and a 4 nm limit for RNAV approaches.
                Different limits can be specified directly; for example <code>/hilpt6nm</code> gives a procedure turn with a 6 nm limit and
                <code>/hilpt2min</code> specifies a 2 minute limit.  For left turns, add a <code>l</code> after the slash, like
                <code>/lhilpt</code>.</li>
              <li><code>/pt45</code>: specifies that there is a standard 45 degree procedure turn at the fix. (This has the same defaults&mdash;
                right turns, 1 minute (ILS) / 4 nm (RNAV)&mdash;as HILPTs. Alternative values are specified the same way.)</li>
              <li><code>/pta</code><i>altitude</i>: if the aircraft should descend during the procedure turn, this can be used to specify
              the final altitude it should have at the end of the turn. (The altitude should be given in 100s of feet.)</li>
              <li><code>/nopt180</code>: specifies that aircraft approaching the fix in the 180 degree semicircle of directions aligned
                with the final approach course should not perform the procedure turn. (As an example, see the <a href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2305/05570RZ8.PDF">KJAX RNAV Z 8</a> approach; this applies for aircraft between heading 346 and 166
              arriving at UDAQI.)</li>
              <li><code>/nopt</code>: when specified at a fix prior to one with a procedure turn, indicates that aircraft that
              pass that fix should not fly the procedure turn.</li>
            </ul>
            
          </section><!--//section-->

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-airlines-aircraft">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Airlines and Aircraft</h2>

            <p>Both departures and arrivals need to know about which airlines fly their routes and which aircraft they use for them.
              Airlines are specified via their ICAO strings (e.g., AAL for American Airlines).  See the file
              <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/blob/master/resources/openscope-airlines.json">openscope-airlines.json</a>
              for the database of possible airlines.
              In that file, each airline may have one or more aircraft fleets specified, in its "fleets" member.
              If no fleet is specified, <i>vice</i> randomly chooses an aircraft type from the "default" fleet, but if
              a particular fleet's aircraft is a better match to a route, you may want to use it.
              For example, AAL's "long" fleet would be a good choice for trans-Atlantic flights.
            </p>
            <p>For reference, the available types of aircraft and their performance characteristics are available in the
              <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/blob/master/resources/openscope-aircraft.json">openscope-aircraft.json</a>
              file.
            </p>
            <p>As is probably obvious, both of these databases are by way of <a href="https://github.com/openscope/openscope">openScope</a>,

              Video map files are simply JSON files with a series of members, each one of which stores an array of strings giving latitude-longitude positions.
              Each successive pair of positions specifies a line to be draw when rendering the video map.
              The following shows an excerpt from the ZNY video maps file that gives a sense of the format.

              There is a utility program for extracting video maps from
              VSTARS configuration files; it is available from the
              <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vstars2vice/releases">vstars2vice
              releases</a> page.  Binaries for both Windows and Mac are
              available.
              It is a command-line program: the first argument should be
              the path to a VSTARS configuration file and the second a path
              to an output file.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Scenario Groups</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> offers users a variety of ATC scenarios, where a scenario consists of one or more airports being controlled,
              a control position (departure, approach, etc.), and airport configurations&mdash;the runways that are active at each
              airport.  Scenarios are organized in <i>scenario groups</i>, which generally collect multiple control scenarios at a single
              airport.
              Each scenario group is specified by its own JSON file; see the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/scenarios"><tt>resources/scenarios/</tt> directory</a> in the
              <i>vice</i> source code distribution for examples.

            <p>There are two pieces for specifying departures: their initial route leaving the airport, which depends on the active departure runway,
              and their subsequent route out of the TRACON, which does not. These two parts are specified separately.</p>
            <p>The "departure_routes" object gives the initial routing for departures, based both on the runway they are departing as well
              as their exit fix.  Here is an excerpt from the KJFK departure routes:
              </p>
            <pre>
  "departure_routes": {
    "13R": {
      "ARD,DIXIE,RBV,WHITE": {
        "cleared_altitude": 5000,
        "route": "JFK5",
        "waypoints": "_JFK_13R _JFK_31L #185"
      },
      ...
            </pre>
            <p>The members of "departure_routes" are strings identifying the departure runway; each departure runway's routes
              are then represented by an object with one or more members that specify comma-separated lists of exit fixes.
              (Thus, the specification above applies to departures with exit ARD, DIXIE, RBV, or WHITE, departing runway 13R.)
              The departure route specification has three members:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>"cleared_altitude": the initial altitude that aircraft are cleared to</li>
                <li>"route": a string naming the route that is added to the start of aircraft's route as shown in flight strips, etc.
                <li>"waypoints": the initial series of waypoints that the aircraft follows. (Here, the first two are custom fixes specified
                  at the ends of the runway.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              On departure the aircraft will fly the specified waypoints and then the waypoints specified in the route
              to its destination. In this case, aircraft will remain on a 185 heading until vectored by the controller
              (as explained in <a href="#fe-routes">Routes</a>, above.)
            </p>

            <p>The other half of specifying departures is the array of objects stored in "departures". Each one describes a departure
              to a particular destination. Here is a JFK departure to Paris Charles de Gaulle:
            </p>
            <pre>
    {
      "airlines": [
        {
          "fleet": "long",
          "icao": "AFR"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "LPFG",
      "exit": "HAPIE",
      "route": "HAPIE YAHOO WHALE N251A JOOPY NATZ MALOT NATZ GISTI LESLU M142 LND N160 NAKID M25 ANNET UM25 UVSUV UM25 INGOR UM25 LUKIP LUKIP9E"
    },
  ...
            </pre>
            <p>Four things must be specified with each departure:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"airlines": The airlines that fly the route and which part of their fleet of aircraft is used; see <a href="#fe-airlines-aircraft">airlines
                    and aircraft</a> below for more information</li>
                <li>"destination": the ICAO airport code for the destination. This is only used in flight strips and for the aircraft's datablock on the
                  radar scope; it does not affect its routing.</li>
                <li>"exit": the exit fix for the departure. In conjunction with the departure runway, this is used to determine the aircraft's
                  route leaving the airport using "departure_routes".</li>
                <li>"route": the aircraft's route to the destination. This is mostly used so that flight strips have plausible routes, though
                  <i>vice</i> does its best to have the aircraft follow the given route after it reaches the exit fix.
              </ul>

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-arrivals">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Arrivals</h2>

            <p>Arrivals are specified via the "arrival_groups" variable, which allows specifying one or more STARs that
              bring aircraft to the TRACON.  Members of "arrival_groups" give the names of arrival groups; each one stores
              an array of one or more arrival objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because arrival rates are specified per-arrival group rather than per-STAR,
              <i>vice</i> can simulate center controllers sequencing multiple STARs into a single arrival flow rather than
              spawning arrivals on two STARs that follow nearby routes and thus should be sequences.
            </p>
            <p>Each object stored in an "arrival_groups" array corresponds to a STAR.
              These objects have the following members:

            <p>STARs are sometimes able to deliver aircraft to multiple airports. Therefore, the "airlines" member
              is an object with airport names as members.  Each of the airports is associated with an array of objects
              that specify departure airports, airlines, and (optionally) airline fleets.  Here is an excerpt from the
              CAMRN4 arrival group at KJFK:
            </p>
            <pre>
  "airlines": {
    "KFRG": [
      {
        "airport": "KDCA",
        "icao": "EJA"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "KJFK": [
      {
        "airport": "MMMY",
        "fleet": "long",
        "icao": "AMX"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
            </pre>
            <p>We can see that CAMRN4 applies to both the KFRG and KJFK airports, though with different airlines
              and different departure airports for the arrivals. The specified departure airports (here, KDCA and MMMY)
              are only used so that flight strips and data blocks on the scope are realistic, but the specified airlines
              are used to select the type of aircraft from their fleets.  As elsewhere, a value for "fleet" may be specified
              to limit which types of aircraft may be chosen.
            </p>

            <p>The "runway_waypoints" member can be used for STARs that have different routes depending on the runway.
              When the user instructs the aircraft to expect a particular approach then the corresponding waypoints are
              added to its route. As an example, the specification of the KPHL <a href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2305/00320JIIMS.PDF">JIIMS4 arrival</a>
              starts with the following string for "waypoints": "HEKMN N039.27.43.645,W074.56.38.400 @ JIIMS@a8000".
              (The second point is used to set the handoff point to be between HEKMN and JIIMS.)
              It then has the following "runway_waypoints", corresponding to the runway-specific routes.
              Note that all start with JIIMS, the same fix at the end of "waypoints".
            </p>

            </table>
            <p>Each member in "boundaries" names a polyline of one or more line segments.  Polylines are specified by arrays of locations.
              The first and second points specify the first line, the second and third points specify the second line, and so forth.
              Here is an example from the KPHL airspace:
              </p>
<pre>
  "PHL_DQO27_33": [
    "N039.21.58.949,W075.28.55.977",

  ]
</pre>
            <p>Note that the first point and the last point are at the same location and thus, "PHL_DQO27_33" is a closed polygon.
              Airspace boundaries do not have to be polygons like this; because boundaries are generally shared between different
              volumes of airspace, it's often useful to define boundaries just as polylines and to assemble multiple boundaries
              to define the lateral extent of a volume of airspace.
            </p>
            <p>Given the boundaries, "volumes" specifies full 3D volumes of airspace.  Airspace volumes have three members; "boundaries"
              is an array of strings that names the boundaries that give the airspace's lateral extent, and "lower" and "upper" specify the
              altitude range of the airspace.  Here is an example from KPHL that uses the boundary defined above:
