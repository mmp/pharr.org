<p>It’s just over a year ago now that I posted an <a href="/matt/blog/2020/12/26/pbr-bibliography-1-3ed.html">analysis of citation counts
in the bibliographies of the first three editions of <em>Physically Based
Rendering</em></a>.  Back then
I promised an update with statistics for the forthcoming fourth
edition “in the next few weeks.”  That turns out to have been rather
optimistic, but here we now are with results finally available.</p>

<p>The fact that these results are ready means that we’re done fiddling with
the text; we will shortly be handing it over to the publisher so that the
book production process can begin.  We have switched to <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu">MIT
Press</a> for the fourth edition and it’s been a
fine experience working with them so far; we’re optimistic that our
interests are all well aligned in producing a quality book, much more so
than with the previous corporate conglomerate that shall not be
named.
Happily, MIT Press has agreed that we can continue to post a free edition
of the book online.  (The current plan is for that to be made available
roughly six months after the print edition hits the shelves.)  However,
that brings us to our first point of drama in this bibliographical vanity
contest: the online edition will be a superset of the print edition and so
there are differences between their bibliographies.</p>

<p>The differences between the two versions are due to the amount of new
content that we wrote for the fourth edition; all in all, it would be about
1,600 printed pages.  That’s too much for a single volume, at least if one
wants paper that isn’t newspaper-thin and a binding that won’t fall apart.
Thus, Wenzel and I went through the exercise of rejiggering the book into a
1,200 page version for print while maintaining the full text for the online
edition.  In deciding what would be online-only, we looked for content that
was mostly independent of the rest of the book and was little-changed from
the third edition.  As examples, both the <a href="https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Camera_Models/Realistic_Cameras">section on realistic camera
models</a> and
the <a href="https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Light_Transport_III_Bidirectional_Methods">chapter on bidirectional light
transport</a>
will not be there in the print edition this time.</p>

<p>The print edition still includes citations and discussion of previous work
for topics that are not included in its text, though not as much of it as
in the online edition—it doesn’t make sense to go into as much depth in
the citations when the text doesn’t deeply discuss the corresponding
topics.  Therefore, here I will report the results for both the print and
online editions. No doubt there will be years of arguments to come about
which is the more proper measure—one might argue that the online
edition’s bibliography is the canonical one, as it reflects what would be
printed if physical limitations didn’t intrude, or one might argue for the
print edition in that those citations earned consumption of actual paper
and not just electrons.  We will leave that question to be resolved by
future historians of computer graphics.</p>

<p>Finally, a few notes on methodology: as before, the following is a simple
count of how often each name appears in the bibliography.  Editing a book
or a conference proceedings doesn’t count, but otherwise every citation is
counted equally—from a single-author SIGGRAPH paper to a blog post.  The
citations include work through SIGGRAPH 2020 but nothing published
subsequently.  Yes, SIGGRAPH Asia papers are now out, but we had to draw a
line somewhere in order to get that thing out the door.</p>

<p>As before, many caveats are in order about how arbitrary a measure this is.
Another to mention today is the impact of the fine series of Eurographics
State of the Art Reports (STARs), twelve of which appear in the fourth
edition’s bibliography.  For topics that are not central to the book (e.g.,
texture synthesis), we will often cite a STAR and only a few additional
publications rather than comprehensively survey previous work.  Thus, there
is an irony in successfully developing a new area of research to the point
that it merits a STAR: in our bibliographic measure, a lengthy publication
record may end up collapsed into a STAR and a few additional citations,
putting one lower than one would have been otherwise.</p>

<!--
Raw data was generated using the following:

```bash
$ grep -v bibitem biblio.tex | 
  fgrep -v "(Ed.)" | fgrep -v "(Eds.)" |
  sed -e "s/~/ /g" -e 's/\\//g' -e 's/{//g' -e 's/}//g' -e "s/'//g" |
  tr -c '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]' |
  sort | uniq -c |
  sort -nr
```

Line by line: the `\bibitem` lines are removed (since those include some
names and we don't want to double-count them), lines that include editor
names are removed, various TeX-isms and accents are stripped out, words are
printed one per line, lines are sorted and their frequency counted, and the
final result is sorted by frequency.  I then went through the output,
disregarding things like that "Carlo" person who seems to keep showing up
in the bibliography, and culling the actual names.
-->

<p>With that, here are the results for all four editions—author last names
with citation counts:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Henrik continues his reign, though he now shares
the top spot with Wojciech Jarosz, who had not a single appearance in the
first edition’s bibliography.  The smallest of lexicographical
differences—“a” before “e”—puts Wojciech first in the alphabetical
ordering.  Fittingly, Wojciech was Henrik’s Ph.D. student, so I have to
assume that for Henrik the bitterness of sharing the glory is balanced by
the sweetness of a former student’s achievement.</p>

<p>Other than Henrik, Alex Keller and Pete Shirley are the only others who
made the list for all four editions, though Pat Hanrahan also has that
distinction if one neglects the online 4th edition.  (Surely Pat will therefore
be out there arguing vigorously that the print edition is canonical.)</p>

<p>Ravi Ramamoorthi has displaced Pete Shirley from his long-held number two
position, though just by a hair, at least in the print edition.  Johannes
Hanika has also rocketed up in the standings, making an especially quick
climb given that he was not cited in either the first or the second
editions.  Carsten Dachsbacher has also climbed rapidly, starting from one
citation in the first edition, two in the second, and 10 in the third.
Finally and fittingly, Jaroslav Křivànek is up there in the latest edition
as well.</p>

<p>There you have it. I must admit my disappointment at seeing that the top
two spots had the same names for both versions of the fourth edition—all
the less potential controversy over which version is the canonical one,
though there’s enough motion farther down the list that one might hope for
some sparks in the future.</p>
