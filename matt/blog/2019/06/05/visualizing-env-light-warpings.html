    <p>(I know, there’s supposedly another post on sampling triangular light
sources coming.  Soon, maybe!)</p>

<p>Recent papers on importance sampling have increasingly often started to
include visualizations of how various sampling techniques warp the
canonical \([0,1)^n\) domain of samples that are used to drive them.
Eric Heitz’s <a href="http://jcgt.org/published/0007/04/01/">recent paper on sampling the GGX
distribution</a> is one example; see
his Figure 7.</p>

<p>Understanding the way that sample warping algorithms distort the uniform
samples that they start out with is important: in general, we’d like to
provide them with well-distributed sample points (e.g. from a
low-discrepancy point set) and we’d like the warping algorithm to not mess
up that distribution—ideally, it should smoothly distort from
\([0,1)^n\) to the target domain without discontinuities and without
stretching much more in one direction than the other.  (This is why Pete
Shirley’s “square to disk” mapping generally gives lower integration error
than the standard polar mapping of samples to the disk. <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Monte_Carlo_Integration/2D_Sampling_with_Multidimensional_Transformations.html#SamplingaUnitDisk">More
details</a>.)</p>

<p>Inspired by recent papers, I decided it would be interesting to make some
visualizations to better understand the differences between algorithms used
for sampling environment map light sources.  Environment maps are generally
used to define a light “at infinity”—in other words, an emissive object
that is infinitely far away, such that the radiance \(L\) arriving at a
point is purely a function of direction \(\omega\).  In general, a good
importance sampling approach for these lights is to warp samples from
\([0,1)^2\) to directions \(\omega\) with probability density
proportional to the luminance of each pixel scaled by the solid angle it
covers.</p>

<h2 id="two-warping-algorithms">Two Warping Algorithms</h2>

<p>There are two widely-used approaches for sampling directions according to an
environment map light source’s distribution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A two-step algorithm based on first sampling a marginal PDF to select a
scanline of the environment map and then sampling a conditional PDF along
the chosen scanline to select a pixel.</li>
  <li>A hierarchical warping algorithm that uses a MIP-map over the environment
map to progressively warp 2D samples until they match the desired
distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first approach is described in <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Light_Transport_I_Surface_Reflection/Sampling_Light_Sources.html#InfiniteAreaLights">Physically Based
Rendering</a>;
see the linked section for details.  Most of the implementation is in
pbrt’s <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/blob/3e9dfd72c6a669848616a18c22f347c0810a0b51/src/core/sampling.h#L123">Distribution2D
class</a>.</p>

<p>The second approach is described in the paper <a href="https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~wjarosz/publications/clarberg05wavelet.html">Wavelet Importance Sampling:
Efficiently Evaluating Products of Complex
Functions</a>,
by Clarberg et al.  (While that paper is mostly about a technique for
sampling according to the product of BSDF and the environment map, their
sample warping algorithm can be applied to the environment map alone.)
They apply a series of linear warps of the form \(f(x) = a(x-b)\) to the
\([0,1)^2\) domain, alternating between the two dimensions.  They take
advantage of the fact that because MIP map texels store averages of the
texels in a region of the image, looking at relative averages shows how to
progressively warp the \([0,1)^2\) domain to match the image.</p>

<p>This figure from their paper gives a flavor of the idea:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/hierarchical-warp.png" /><i>
The first step of the hierarchical sample warping algorithm: the four pixel
values from the first MIP level below the root give the relative fraction
of samples that should be allocated to the corresponding quarters of the
image.  In turn, the sampling domain is warped accordingly,
here first in y and then in x. Further linear warpings are applied at each
successive MIP level.  </i></p>

<p>Here’s my implementation of the hierarchical warping algorithm (<a href="/matt/blog/images/hierwarp.h">.h</a>,
<a href="/matt/blog/images/hierwarp.cpp">.cpp</a>.)  It comes from the next version of pbrt, so it doesn’t compile
as is, but I don’t think it’d be too hard to get it working,
especially as part of the current version of pbrt.</p>

<h2 id="visual-comparison-of-distortion">Visual Comparison of Distortion</h2>

<p>In order to better understand how the two warps work in practice, I created
some visualizations of how they distort strata from the \([0,1)^2\) sample domain.
I split the domain into \(16 \times 16\) strata and assigned a different color to each
one, which has us starting out with this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/original-strata.png" /></p>

<p>Then for both mappings, I computed the inverse mapping: for each pixel in
the environment map, I determined which sample value in \([0,1)^2\)
mapped to that pixel, and in turn colored the environment map pixel
according to the strata colors above.  The resulting images give a sense of
how the original strata are distorted by the warping.</p>

<p>I chose three environment maps from <a href="https://hdrihaven.com/">HDRI Haven</a>
for evaluation: <a href="https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?h=snowy_park_01">Snowy Park
01</a>,
<a href="https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?h=surgery">Surgery</a>, and
<a href="https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?h=qwantani">Qwantani</a>.  They range from having
relatively uniform illumination (<em>Snowy park</em>) to localized extremely
bright illumination (<em>Qwantani</em>).  <em>Surgery</em> is somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Here are the results, via <a href="https://jeri.io">jeri</a>.  They’re best viewed on
a laptop or desktop computer.  Click on the tabs to switch between the
environment maps and the visualizations.  After selecting the image below,
I encourage you to hit ‘f’ to go full screen in order to be able to see the
details well.  Hit ‘?’ to see a list of all of the keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>The thing to look for in these visualizations is “how are the strata
distorted?” (and in turn, “how do I feel about that?”)</p>

<p>The results are… interesting.</p>

<p><em>Snowy park</em> is a fairly straightforward case.  Visually, I think that the
hierarchical warp does best here, mostly maintaining pretty much
rectangular strata.  I see at least one case where part of a stratum has
been sheared off and is disconnected from the rest of it, but otherwise it
looks pretty good.  The 2D warp goes a bit wavy; what we’re seeing is
adjacent scanlines with significantly different sampling distributions so
that the second sampling step warps the points very differently from
scanline to scanline.  Nevertheless, all of the original strata remain
connected, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>The results are along similar lines for <em>Surgery</em> though there we can see
the differences between how the two warping functions pull samples to
the bright lights.  With the hierarchical warp, we see fairly
distorted strata all around the lights, where the distortion happens in
both dimensions.  With the two dimensional warp, the scanlines with bright
lights have that same wavy distortion we saw with <em>Snowy park</em>, just much
more so.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s <em>Qwantani</em>.  The sun is about 150,000 times brighter than
the blue sky around it and therefore much of the sampling domain is pulled
toward the sun’s direction.  With the hierarchical warp, we can see that
quite a few strata have been broken into pieces and many of the remaining
ones are stretched much more in one dimension than the other.  The 2D warp
has plenty of its own distortion, though for better or for worse, it’s
localized in the scanlines that include the sun and its reflection.</p>

<p>Conclusion? I don’t know—warping’s hard.  Rendering tests with those
three environment maps indicate that both warping functions give similar
error, so there’s no clear winner between them on that front, either.  “Use
whichever approach is most efficient on your target architecture” is all
I’ve got to offer for a conclusion for today.</p>
