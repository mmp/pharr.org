    <p>It’s now been just over three months since Wenzel, Greg, and I put
<em>Physically Based Rendering</em> <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org">online</a>.  I’m happy
to say that I can now start to relax as I’ve started to become comfortable
that we don’t seem to have made any horribly embarrassing errors in the
conversion to the online edition.  I’m even getting over having seen it
described a few times as a “free online ebook,” a phrase that has never
exactly sounded like a hallmark of high quality to me.</p>

<p>We don’t use any tracking scripts and aren’t logging page requests, so we
have little insight into how many people are making use of the online
edition, which sections are getting the most attention, and so forth.
Occasionally, I wish we knew a little more about that, but I also like the
idea of trying to do something well and then putting it out there without
worrying about trying to measure how it’s being received.  Sort of a little
strike against the dopamine of likes, retweets, and engagement-driven
metrics (oh hai, PMs!), if you will.</p>

<p>There are two measures we do have available, however, so we’re not fully
dopamine-free around here.  They are the amount of bandwidth used to serve
the website and the total number of http requests.  (It so happens that
those are also the two things that Google charges us for.) From those, we
can see that we passed the terabyte milestone a few weeks ago, and as of
January 21, 2019, just over 1.3 TB of data has been served for
<a href="http://www.pbr-book.org">pbr-book.org</a>, over a total of 2.6 million
individual http requests.</p>

<p>After a first spike at launch, it’s been a fairly consistent 9 GB or so of
bandwidth per day since then.  6% of it has been to China and 18% to the
rest of APAC.  For the other 76%, we don’t have any further insight other
than Australia doing its part at 1.25%.</p>

<p>A full read-through of the online version of book consumes about 300 MB of
bandwidth, so we’re serving it up at a pace of corresponds to about 4,500
full readings of the book in 3 months.  (I assume, however, that more of
the accesses are from people looking up specific topics.)  Although some of
that bandwidth is presumably web crawlers, the total is much more than I’d
have expected, which is a nice reward for the work it took to prepare the
online edition.</p>

<p>The total serving costs so far add up to about $175, so the free version is
sustainable, especially with the help of everyone who is supporting the
online edition on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pbrbook">patreon</a>—that more
than covers the hosting costs—thanks, patreon supporters!</p>

<p>With the online third edition of the book in good shape, we’ve started work
on an updated edition of <em>Physically Based Rendering</em> for 2019.  It will
have roughly half as much updated as has been between the previous printed
editions of the book, but I think we’ve got a healthy bunch of improvements
in the queue, including full-spectral rendering, many improvements to
samplers and sampling routines, a many-light sampling implementation, and
various reductions in memory use. We’re very much looking forward to
getting that update out and available to everyone (though there’s a lot of
work to do, and it will certainly be late in the year!)</p>
