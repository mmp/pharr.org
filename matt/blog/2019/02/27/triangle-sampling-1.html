    <p>Illumination from area lights is one of those wonderful things that just
works with path tracing; a nice big light source gives realistic soft
lighting that matches most real-world lighting much better than a couple of
point lights, for example.  Part of using Monte Carlo integration to
estimate direct lighting from an area light involves choosing a point on
the light source’s surface, tracing a shadow ray to it, and adding a
contribution from the light if the shadow ray is unoccluded.</p>

<p>Regular practice is to generate a random (or, better, quasi-random)
2-dimensional point in [0,1)<sup>2</sup> and apply a transformation that warps the
canonical [0,1)<sup>2</sup> domain to the surface of the light source.  (A variety of
these warpings are cataloged in <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Monte_Carlo_Integration/2D_Sampling_with_Multidimensional_Transformations.html">Section
13.6</a>
of <em>Physically Based Rendering</em>.)</p>

<p>These warpings are normally designed to minimize distortion: as much as
possible, we’d like nearby sample points to remain nearby after the
transformation to the light’s surface.  This is particularly important if
carefully-constructed sample points like low-discrepancy samples are being
used; a good transformation can maintain the error-reducing properties in
their distribution, which in turn reduces error.</p>

<p>Some distortion can’t be avoided in cases where we’re warping between
significantly different domains.  For example, if we’re mapping from the
square [0,1)<sup>2</sup> domain to a triangle, some pinching or a folding
is unavoidable.  I’ve always not worried much about those distortions: I
have assumed it wasn’t something that made much of a difference in
practice, and didn’t think there was much to do about it once you’d chosen
a decent mapping.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I was wrong about all of that, and that’s what we’ll dig
into today.</p>

<h2 id="previous-state-of-the-art">Previous State of the Art</h2>

<p>Consider sampling a point on a triangular light source: most commonly,
people use a mapping that takes a 2-dimensional sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">u</code> and
gives the barycentric coordinates of a point inside the triangle, sampled
with uniform probability—in other words, all points on the triangle are
chosen with equal probability if the sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">u</code> is uniformly
distributed.  Here’s its implementation:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; UniformSampleTriangle(const Point2f &amp;u) {
    float su0 = std::sqrt(u[0]);
    float b0 = 1 - su0;
    float b1 = u[1] * su0;
    return { b0, b1, 1.f - b0 - b1 };
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s see how using that mapping works out in practice.  Here’s a plot of
64 pmj02bn sample points, which were described in Christensen et al.’s
<a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProgressiveMultiJitteredSampling/">EGSR
paper</a>
last year.  I think they’re the best two-dimensional sample points out there at the
moment.  They’re carefully optimized to satisfy a number of useful
properties, including the power-of-2 elementary intervals and not clumping
together too much.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/pmj02bn-2d.png" />
<br />
<i>64 pmj02bn sample points.</i></p>

<p>It’s a good looking point set.  Now let’s map those points to a triangle,
using the mapping defined above.  Here’s what we get:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/pmj02bn-tri.png" /><br />
<i>64 pmj02bn sample points mapped to a triangle.
</i></p>

<p>It’s <em>fine</em>, but if you want to pick nits, you can find some things to be
unhappy about: here and there you can find clusters of a few points that
are fairly close together, and there are also some pretty big areas that
don’t have any points at all in them.</p>

<h2 id="basu-and-owens-mapping">Basu and Owen’s Mapping</h2>

<p>In 2014, <a href="http://www.kinjalbasu.com/">Kinjal Basu</a> and <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/">Art
Owen</a> published a paper, <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/reports/triangleqmc.pdf"><em>Low
discrepancy constructions in the
triangle</em></a>.  The
fact that I just read it a few weeks ago is a pretty good indication of
what a dumpster fire my reading pile is.</p>

<p>Their approach is based on mapping a 1-dimensional sample in [0,1) onto the
surface of the triangle—already we have something new and
thought-provoking going on, their not using a 2-dimensional sample.  They
use the digits of the base-4 digital representation of that number to
select a point inside the triangle in a way that’s reminiscent of choosing
a point along a space-filling curve and in turn get pretty
nicely-distributed points.</p>

<p>To make the idea concrete, say that we have a (base ten) sample value of
0.125.  Converted to base 4, we have 0.02.  (The first digit to the right
of the radix point is contributes its value times 1/4, the second
contributes its value times 1/16, and so forth.  Thus, we have 0/4 + 2/16 = 1/8,
our original sample value.)</p>

<p>Given the sample value in base 4, their mapping considers its digits in
turn, from most to least significant.  The first digit is used to choose
one of four sub-triangles, illustrated on the left side of this figure
(from their paper).  Next, the second digit is used to choose
a sub-triangle within that sub-triangle (shown on the right), and so forth.
For our 0.125 sample, we end up with that “02” sub-triangle on the right.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/ld-triangle-digits.png" height="200" /><br />
<i>How digits in the base-4 sample value are successively
used to select sub-triangles in the original triangle.  Here, the
sub-triangles for the first digit (left) and first and second digits
(right) are shown.
</i></p>

<p>Here are 64 samples generated using this approach.  Note that they are
fairly evidently more evenly distributed than the warped pmj02bn points,
though there’s also some visible structure to them.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/owen-tri.png" /><br />
<i>64 samples in a triangle generated using Basu and Owen's algorithm.</i></p>

<h2 id="sample-points-and-randomization">Sample Points and Randomization</h2>

<p>The 1-dimensional sample points used for their mapping must be chosen
carefully.  Basu and Owen use the <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Sampling_and_Reconstruction/The_Halton_Sampler.html#HammersleyandHaltonSequences">van der Corput
points</a>,
which in base 4 are 0.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.02, etc.  Given a power-of-four
number of such sample points, we can see that each applicable sub-triangle
will be selected exactly once.</p>

<p>How important is it to use those points?  Here’s what happens if you use
their mapping using 64 stratified one-dimensional samples:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/owen-with-stratified.png" /><br /> <i>Sample points
generated using regular stratified samples with Basu and Owen's mapping.
Their distribution is much worse than if van der Corput points are
used.</i></p>

<p>You get a much worse distribution of sample points, even though thanks to
stratification, each of the 64 applicable sub-triangles still has exactly
one sample in it.  Thus, we can see that both the points and the mapping
are key to their method.</p>

<p>In turn, you might ask yourself how much of the benefit from their approach
comes from the sample points being regularly distributed and whether the
traditional approach could benefit from more of that.  For a sense of that,
here’s what happens if a regular grid of unjittered sample points is put
through the traditional mapping.  The distortion introduced by the mapping
is fairly easily seen.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/grid-with-regular.png" /><br />
<i>64 2-dimensional samples in a regular grid, using the traditional
mapping.  The mapping's distortion is evident.</i></p>

<p>One would still like some variation in the points sampled on the triangle
from pixel to pixel—we’d see structured error in images if we didn’t
somehow randomize the samples across pixels.  One approach that doesn’t
destroy the mapped points’ distribution is to apply a Cranley-Patterson
rotation to the one-dimensional sample points before mapping them to the triangle.  The
idea is to add an offset in [0,1), different at each pixel but the same for
all samples in a pixel, and to then use the fractional part of the result
to sample a point in the triangle:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    u += delta;  // delta between 0 and 1
    if (u &gt; 1) u -= 1;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A good way to compute those offsets is with <a href="http://momentsingraphics.de/?p=127">blue noise
textures</a> which ensure that nearby
pixels have significantly different offsets, which in turn leads to error
being manifested with high-frequency noise, which is <a href="https://www.arnoldrenderer.com/research/dither_abstract.pdf">visually
pleasing</a>.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation of Basu and Owen’s technique is pretty straightforward.
Given a sample value in [0,1), we first multiply by 2<sup>32</sup> and
convert to an integer, effectively giving us a 0.32 fixed-point base-2
representation of the sample.</p>

<p>Here’s the start of the implementation:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>std::array&lt;Float, 3&gt; LowDiscrepancySampleTriangle(Float u) {
    uint32_t uf = u * (1ull &lt;&lt; 32);           // Convert to fixed point
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We maintain the barycentric coordinates of the three corners of the current
sub-triangle using variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>, taking advantage of the
fact that we only need to track two barycentric coordinates for each one,
since we can always get the third by subtracting the other two from 1.  We
can extract the base-4 digits just by taking pairs of those binary digits.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Point2f A(1, 0), B(0, 1), C(0, 0);        // Barycentrics
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i) {            // For each base-4 digit
        int d = (uf &gt;&gt; (2 * (15 - i))) &amp; 0x3; // Get the digit
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Given the digit, there are a series of rules (given in the paper) that give
the updated barycentrics.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>        Point2f An, Bn, Cn;
        switch (d) {
        case 0:
            An = (B + C) / 2;
            Bn = (A + C) / 2;
            Cn = (A + B) / 2;
            break;
        case 1:
            An = A;
            Bn = (A + B) / 2;
            Cn = (A + C) / 2;
            break;
        case 2:
            An = (B + A) / 2;
            Bn = B;
            Cn = (B + C) / 2;
            break;
        case 3:
            An = (C + A) / 2;
            Bn = (C + B) / 2;
            Cn = C;
            break;
        }
        A = An;
        B = Bn;
        C = Cn;
    }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And finally, when we’re out of digits, we just take the sample at the
center of the small sub-triangle that we’re in:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Point2f r = (A + B + C) / 3;
    return { r.x, r.y, 1 - r.x - r.y };
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The sample points on the triangle look nice enough, but how do things work
out with actual rendering?  Here’s a simple scene, rendered with 16 samples per
pixel, using pmj02bn points, and multiple importance sampling.  The two images below 
show the difference between the traditional mapping and the new one.</p>

<div class="card-img-top" style="display:block; width: 100%; padding-top: 77.083%;  position:relative;">
<div id="Sampling60" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;"></div></div>
<script>
Jeri.renderViewer(document.getElementById('Sampling60'), {
  title: 'Sampling60', children: [
 { title: 'Traditional mapping', image: '/matt/blog/images/regular-tri-rendered.png' },
 { title: 'Basu-Owen mapping', image: '/matt/blog/images/owen-tri-rendered.png' }
 ]});
</script>

<p>(Click on the tabs to switch images, or use the number keys after selecting the image. Hit ‘f’ to go fullscreen. You can also pan and zoom using the mouse.)</p>

<p>The reduction in noise is fairly obvious.  The second image actually has
2.17x less variance than the first one.  (And recall, that means that the
first image would need 2.17x more rays to achieve the same error.)
Success!</p>

<p>Now, this is admittedly a scene that is favorable to the method: if the
light source was small, for example, the benefit would be less.  Still,
it’s a pretty nice improvement for not too much more work.</p>

<p><i>Next time, we’ll consider applying this approach to sampling spherical
triangles, which gets interesting in its own ways.</i></p>
