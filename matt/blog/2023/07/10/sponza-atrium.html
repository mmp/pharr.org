    <p>Back in the early 2000s, the <a href="http://hdri.cgtechniques.com">CGTechniques
website</a> had a “rendering challenge”, where
an interesting model would be posted and then artists would try to make the
best rendering they could of it.  I remember how remarkable the images were
in those early days of global illumination–seeing complex 3D models
coupled with beautiful lighting was incredibly inspiring, especially when
there were few especially interesting scenes available for use in rendering
research.  One of the models used for the challenge was the now-famous
“Sponza Atrium,” created by Marko Dabrovic.  The CGTechniques website is
remarkably still online, but the <a href="http://hdri.cgtechniques.com/~sibenik2/">contest
pages</a> are missing images, though
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030221053202/http://hdri.cgtechniques.com/~sibenik2/">archive.org delivers some of them at
least</a>.</p>

<p>In those days of the rendering challenge, Greg Humphreys and I were in the
thick of working on the first edition of <em>Physically Based Rendering</em>.  We
were desperate for good scenes to render.  I got in touch with Marko and he
was more than happy to give us permission to use the Sponza Atrium model in
the book and to help with the conversion.  In addition to the atrium and a
model of the Šibenik Cathedral, less famous though still wonderful, Marko
and his colleague Mihovil Odak had a nice model of an Audi TT that we made
extensive use of as well.  They were all great scenes, especially for those
days; we kept using them in the book through the third edition, only now
moving on to new ones, two decades later.</p>

<p>I was recently able to visit Croatia, home to the originals for the Sponza
Atrium and Šibenik Cathedral models.  I didn’t make it to Šibenik, so
missed the cathedral, but I did visit Dubrovnik, home of the Sponza
Palace.  You get a nice postcard when you pay the entrance fee.</p>

</a>
</p>

<p>The Sponza Place is now home to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik_Archive">Dubrovnik State
Archive</a>. A room at the
entrance has a memorial to the 200 soldiers who died defending Dubrovnik
during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Dubrovnik">Siege of
Dubrovnik</a>.  The Palace
itself was damaged then, hit by a number of shells.  You couldn’t tell now,
nor do you see any hint of the broader devastation to the city, just 30
years ago.</p>

<p>It was quiet when I visited the Palace even though the streets of
Dubrovnik outside were packed with tourists.  And by quiet I mean that no
one else was in the Atrium most of the time I was there, not that I’m
complaining.  I’m happy to confirm that the GI effects are impressive to
see in person.</p>

</p>

<p>I took advantage of the emptiness and recorded <a href="https://pub-3d16d67d2c68402fa2fb05197bac91f9.r2.dev/sponza%20atrium.MOV">a three-minute long
video</a>,
walking about and panning my camera around to capture the details as well
as I could.  Here’s a low-resolution GIF of the first 20 seconds of it.
(Caution: I find it a little nausea-inducing to view the video now; the
goal was a thorough capture rather than something pleasing for human
consumption.)  I offer it up as fodder for a fun NeRF, or at least as
reference to the original.</p>
