    <blockquote>
  <p>Excellence withers without an adversary: the time for us to see how
great it is, how much its force, is when it displays its power through
endurance.  I assure you, good men should do the same: they should not be
afraid to face hardships and difficulties, or complain of fate; whatever
happens, good men should take it on good part, and turn it to a good end;
it is not what you endure that matters, but how you endure it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Seneca, <em>On Providence</em></p>

<p>There were a lot of not fun times at Intel. Although I’m happy to be no
longer be there today, it yet turned out to be a time of technical creativity
and building something I’m still proud of.</p>

<p>In spite of the insanity, I can’t say I completely regret that time today.
Maybe some of that is the passage of time, the dulling of the memories of
the stress, forgetting the feeling of powerlessness when the politics were
churning.  Some of it is knowing that in the end, it actually all worked
out ok.</p>

<p>Google prides itself on the whole “Googliness” idea, the idea that everyone
there is a good happy friendly person, that everyone’s helping each other
and all pulling in the same direction.  It’s basically so: I’ve only had to
deal with the sharp-elbowed kind of politics once in five years and that
instance was quickly shut down by management.  There’s definitely none of
the co-workers actively undermining you stuff.  As far as I’ve seen, those
sorts of tactics are quickly rejected by Google’s cultural antibodies.</p>

<p>Google’s a pleasant place to be.  I wouldn’t want it to be any other way.
But sometimes I struggle with the question of whether there are trade-offs.</p>

<p>Would I have written volta in a more Googley environment?</p>

<p>More to the point: would I have written it in an environment where there
weren’t a few influential jerks who I really wanted to prove wrong?</p>

<p>To be clear, I’ve also done a few things at Google that I think went well
without that motivation—it’s a great environment to work in.  I don’t
think jerks are a necessary ingredient for progress, but I can’t help
wondering if in the end, they may have contributed to ispc in their own
way.</p>

<p>Maybe Seneca’s on to something.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading this far. Tomorrow we’ll start in on my memoir of
Larrabee.  I kid, I kid. We’re done.  No way I’m going there and I’m
overdue for a blogging vacation.</em></p>
