    <p><em>Note: in these posts, I’m not going to go into comprehensive detail about
how ispc/volta works on a technical level, what the precursors were, or
what all of the key design goals were.  I’ll touch on some of that as is
relevant to the narrative, but see the <a href="/matt/papers/ispc_inpar_2012.pdf">paper I wrote about ispc with Bill
Mark</a> for comprehensive
discussion of all that.  It’s worth a read (IMHO), if you’re taking the
time to read this.  (Bill will appear later in this story.)</em></p>

<p>With the defensive perimeter established, I was off. There was a long way
to go to turn volta into something generally useful.  Plenty of basic
language functionality wasn’t implemented yet—for example, I’m pretty
sure things like structs weren’t even working at that point.</p>

<p>Throughout the design and implementation of volta, I thought a lot about
C. I re-read K&amp;R for inspiration for the n’th time along the way.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/k-and-r.jpg" width="300" /></p>

<p>It wasn’t just the availability of a C grammar that made me start psl with
C: I like C a lot; it’s a wonderfully crisp language.  It was obvious to me
that I’d continue using C as a basis for volta, deviating from it as little
as possible.  Not only had Kernighan and Ritchie obviously gotten so many
things right, but the language is well-known, and if volta was ever
finished, it would be more easily adopted by people if the syntax was
familiar.</p>

<p>I took much more than syntax from C—its design principles were much more
important.  C had a close mapping to the hardware of the day, and a good
programmer can look at C code and pretty accurately guess which
instructions a compiler will generate for that code.  No mystery, no
compiler magic, no innocuous looking statements that may explode into a slew of
instructions (I’m looking at you, C++).  I wanted volta to maintain that.</p>

<p>I imagined Kernighan and Ritchie designing C in today’s world.  How would C
be different if it was designed for today’s CPUs?  Two big things had
changed in CPU architecture: multi-core processing and SIMD vector
units.<sup id="fnref:micro"><a href="#fn:micro" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For multi-core, there were plenty of good ideas to draw from.  Andrew
Lauritzen, who knew about all of them and had thought a lot about this
stuff, was a big fan of Cilk’s approach to multi-threading—functions
could call other functions asynchronously, those could run in separate
threads, and the compiler waited for them to all finish before the original
function could return.  This nicely enabled parallel composition.</p>

<p>So I added a <code class="highlighter-rouge">launch</code> keyword to volta; it used Cilk’s semantics.  Put it
before a function call and the function goes off to a thread pool:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>launch foo(a, 6.3);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Even though that’s not <em>that</em> much syntactically cleaner than calling out
to TBB or the like (especially now, with C++11 lambdas), it felt nice to
have that as a first-class thing in the language.  It was basically zero
friction multi-threading, which seemed right for this era.</p>

<p>For SIMD, one obvious option would be to expose that capability of the CPU
using explicit vector data types—this is basically what lots of people
have done by hand, wrapping intrinsics around <code class="highlighter-rouge">vec4f</code> classes and the like.
That would certainly be useful to have as a first-class feature of the
language, and for some types of computation, explicit vectors end up being
a cleaner way of expressing them.</p>

<p>As should already be clear by now, I really wanted to write programs with
complex control flow that still ran on SIMD hardware; for that, explicit
vectors aren’t very convenient, and so SPMD on SIMD it was.  I think that
is a good fit for the philosophy of C as well: straightforward and
predictable, no deep compiler magic behind it.</p>

<p>Maybe K&amp;R would have decided to made both options available, and having
both often would have been nice; then, for example, one could write a
program that targeted 16-wide AVX-512, with 4 SPMD program instances, each
of which could do a 4-wide vector operation with each instruction.  We’ll
come back to that topic later, in the retrospective.</p>

<h2 id="making-spmd-on-simd-happen">Making SPMD on SIMD happen</h2>

<p>As I experienced in Sweden, vectorizing straight-line code is
easy—there’s nothing to it if you’re not trying to prove that
vectorization is safe first.  The trickier part is implementing general
control flow for SPMD programs.  We’d like different SPMD program instances
to take different paths through the program, and still compute correct
results.</p>

<p>Intrinsics programmers know how this is done: when conditionally processing
a values in a vector, you maintain an additional mask variable that records
which of them should be modified.  If you have something that’s logically
like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (a &lt; b)
  c = 0;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>operating on vector-valued <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>, then you store a mask that
records the vector result of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a &lt; b</code> and then use that to conditionally
assign zero to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> vector.  If there’s an <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> statement, then you
negate the mask and then execute its code, minding the mask.  Kayvon
Fatahalian has a <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15869-f11/www/lectures/07_gpucore.pdf">great set of
slides</a>
that talks about this and how it’s handled on GPUs; it’s all surprisingly
similar, with a little more help from the hardware.</p>

<p>More generally, loops, <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">continue</code> statements, even indirect
function calls through pointers—all of that can be executed in vector
form by using the same idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain an execution mask that records which program instances
(SIMD lanes) are active.</li>
  <li>Execute vector instructions according to a conservative control
flow path through the program.  In other words, execute an instruction if
any of the lanes needs to.</li>
  <li>Make sure that no side effects are visible from inactive program
instances—unintended memory writes or the like.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these can be a bit fiddly to get right, but they’re conceptually
straightforward principles.</p>

<p>The rules to maintain the execution mask for loops are only slightly more
complicated than for an <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement.  The value of the loop test gives
the execution mask for the loop body and you run the loop until that’s
false for all of the active program instances.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> in a loop just
disables the active mask for any elements where the mask is active when the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> statement executes; the active mask for them is restored after the
loop finishes.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">continue</code> disables the mask for an instance until the
end of the current iteration, at which point it’s restored.  And so forth.</p>

<p>It took a while to get this mask maintenance stuff implemented properly in
volta.  It was thrilling once it was all really solid, especially since
LLVM continued to be reliable, giving me good x86 assembly as long as I
gave it good vectorized IR.</p>

<p>Here’s a small example with a volta/ispc program that raises a float to an
integer power with an inefficient algorithm. (Note that this program is
also valid C.)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>float powi(float a, int b) {
    float r = 1;
    while (b--)
        r *= a;
    return r;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here’s the assembly code that comes out of the compiler today. (Note: AT+T
syntax, with the destination as the last argument.)  Here I’ve used AVX2,
since it’s cleaner than SSE4, though SSE4 was the only ISA that volta
initially supported.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>LBB0_3:
	vpaddd    %ymm5, %ymm1, %ymm8
	vblendvps %ymm7, %ymm8, %ymm1, %ymm1
	vmulps    %ymm0, %ymm3, %ymm7
	vblendvps %ymm6, %ymm7, %ymm3, %ymm3
	vpcmpeqd  %ymm4, %ymm1, %ymm8
	vmovaps   %ymm6, %ymm7
	vpandn    %ymm6, %ymm8, %ymm6
	vpand     %ymm2, %ymm6, %ymm8
	vmovmskps %ymm8, %eax
	testl     %eax, %eax
	jne       LBB0_3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first two instructions decrement <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, using the active active vector
mask to perform the assignment only for the active lanes.  The next two
multiply <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> by <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, again using the mask.  Then <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> is compared for
equality with zero and the result is used to update the execution
mask. (Updating the mask takes an extra instruction due the fact that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">powi()</code> may have been called with a not-all-on execution mask, so we have
to AND the mask at <code class="highlighter-rouge">powi()</code>’s entry.  In this case, it’d be fine if we
skipped that and computed bogus results for the disabled lanes, but in general
we need an accurate mask in case there’s something like a memory write that
needs to be squashed for inactive lanes.)  Finally, a quick check with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">movmsk</code> to see if any lanes are still active before jumping to the start
of the loop again.</p>

<p>And that’s it.  I think it’s optimal, save for the unneeded precision in
the maintenance of the execution mask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>  I’ll happily take the occasional
stray extra instruction over having to write intrinsics by hand, especially
for programs that are non-trivial.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-optimizations-versus-transformations">Compiler optimizations versus transformations</h2>

<p>Having seen this example, it’s easier to understand another super insightful
point from T. Foley: compiling a SPMD program for SIMD hardware is a
compiler transformation, which is an entirely different thing than a
compiler optimization.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>This insight gets back to the problem with auto-vectorization: it’s a
complex optimization, full of heuristics, and you can’t be sure where it’s
going to end up.  The compiler is trying to reason about the safety of
vectorizing a loop—are there any loop-carried dependencies?  One can only
go so far with reasoning about arbitrary programs with a computer program
(remember that pesky halting problem), so auto-vectorizers are doomed to be
brittle and unpredictable to the user.</p>

<p>SPMD on SIMD? That’s a <em>transformation</em>.  We just saw how to do it.  It’s
mechanical.  If you’ve automated it, there’s no reason it won’t always
work.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this is that it fits with the C philosophy: any
programmer who understands the idea can accurately predict what code the
compiler will generate, and it’s pretty much the code they would have
written by hand; for performance-aware programmers, the first property is
just as important as the second.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In the end, volta’s kind of a dumb compiler; there’s not really anything
deeply clever in its implementation.  Other than a lot of engineering work,
the key was approaching the problem in the right way in the first place.</p>

<p><em>Next time, we’ll finally get to sharing first results with the compiler
 team.</em></p>
