    <p>After Sweden, I still had my day job at Intel that didn’t involve writing a
compiler; I was the tech lead of the advanced rendering group.  At the
time, I reported to Elliot Garbus, then the VP in charge of graphics software.</p>

<p>Elliot was the best manager I’ve ever had.  To be honest, I didn’t expect
that at first: while he’d been technical early in his career, it’d been
years since he had done anything hands-on, and his background wasn’t in
graphics anyway.  It wasn’t clear to me that we had enough in common for
much to come out of relationship, but he seemed nice enough at least.</p>

<p>Elliot turned out to be impressively intellectually curious; he always had
insightful questions when I talked to him about the things I and the
rendering group were working on.  In time, I also came to learn that you
could completely trust him to have your back; this was really helpful in
the highly political environment of Intel. These were both great
foundations.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I came to learn that he was a master of coming to
understand the people who worked for him and then effectively guiding and
coaching them.  Sometimes other people can understand you in ways that you
hadn’t understood yourself, and Elliot was great at that.  One felt that he
truly cared about finding ways to help you grow as a person, pushing you in
directions that were a little uncomfortable but worth stretching for.  I’ve
never had that sort of experience with another manager.</p>

<p>I was planning on leaving Intel the Fall after Sweden.  I was burned out on
the place after the drama of Larrabee and had already been making
arrangements for the transition with Elliot.  As we worked through the
details, Elliot continued to be intrigued by each new result from volta as
it came in.  I was still hacking away on it.
He’d seen first-hand how problematic it had been to not be able to use
Larrabee’s vector units effectively, and encouraged me to stick around and
see where volta went.  He argued that if I walked away, we’d never know if
the approach really worked or not.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he convinced me to stay in the end, remaining at Intel as an
individual contributor, just working on volta.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/volta.jpg" width="300" /></p>

<h2 id="stayin-alive">Stayin’ alive</h2>

<p>If I was going to stay, it was important to me to have confidence that
volta wouldn’t be killed.  In the political environment of Intel, it very
well might have happened at some point along the way.</p>

<p>For example, if I was actually in the compiler team, quite possibly at some
point some folks would have stepped in and said, “Great, <em>now</em> we
understand.  Thank you <em>so</em> much!  We got this—we’ll take it from here and
implement this in the commercial compiler. Oh, and there’s no need for you
to work on volta any more since that would just be wasted work.”  And if
they sold management on that idea (quite possible), then that’d be the end
of volta, regardless of whether they actually went through with their side
of it.</p>

<p>In a rational world, that sort of thing wouldn’t happen: why wouldn’t they
want their compiler to be the best it could be, regardless of where the
ideas came from?  It may have been that some of the folks who had
established themselves as the experts in this area were more concerned with
maintaining the appearance of mastery of the topic than anything else.  It
also may have been that they still didn’t believe in the use-case volta was
attacking—the HPC community was apparently plenty happy with
auto-vectorization, and that seemed to matter the most.</p>

<p>In any case, it was quite possible that in the future, some of them would
have been happy to have this thorn in their side just go away, so I had to
be careful.</p>

<p>Elliot was key to my confidence that my work wouldn’t be wasted.  I knew he
would protect the project, and he agreed that I could open-source the
compiler once it was ready.  It was really important to me that I could do
that; once volta was open source, there was no way it could be killed
through Intel politics.  To open source software at Intel, all that was
needed was VP approval (and going through some straightforward process), so
with his agreement, I could get to work with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="on-jerks-and-institutional-acceptance-of-them">On jerks and institutional acceptance of them</h2>

<p>A few more words to explain why I had these worries.</p>

<p>First, to be absolutely clear, there were lots of great people at Intel and
specifically in Intel’s compiler team.  There were plenty of good engineers
doing good work, perfectly nice people who wanted to do the right thing.
By numbers, they were by far the majority.</p>

<p>The problem was that just a few jerks, especially in positions of power or
influence, could fuck you up real good.</p>

<p>Intel had more than its share of them and therefore, everyone at Intel balanced some
amount of technical work with some amount of politics work.  You had to.
Politics was more than the standard “advocate for yourself” stuff; at
minimum it was periodically defending yourself against attacks from others
who wanted your territory and would try to get your project shut down so
they could take it.</p>

<p>Some people there approached their work with little in way of technological
contributions, but a lot of politics. It turned out that that could be a
perfectly successful career strategy—undermining others as necessary to
maintain and advance your position without ever actually delivering much of
substance yourself.  Those were the jerks.</p>

<p>One thing that made it easier for them was the fact that software career
path at Intel was all about getting away from coding ASAP—writing code
was for new grads and less expensive engineers in foreign countries.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
The glory was being in an architect, never coding yourself, but setting
direction.  In that role, one could go far without producing anything more
than slide decks, I mean foils.</p>

<p>Because there were the jerks out there, you always had to be aware of
them. Even if you didn’t want to pursue that model for your own career, you had
to defend against them or you’d be wiped out.</p>

<p>I never understood why Intel upper management didn’t seem bothered by their
presence.  I suppose that once that mode of success takes root, it’s
cancerous to the organization and would be hard to root out.  Perhaps they
figured that Intel was doing pretty well as a company, so why fix what
ain’t broke?  Maybe they saw it as a good kind of aggressiveness and were
happy with the idea of everyone fighting it out, gladiators in the
Colosseum fighting each other to win, all for the glory of Intel.</p>

<p>Sometimes the management enablers of the jerks would encourage you to
“assume best intentions” in your interactions with them.  You’d quickly be
out-maneuvered if you did; they didn’t play that game, and knew to take
advantage of any opening they were given.</p>

<p>Elliot never told me to “assume best intentions” with them.</p>

<p>As he helped me figure out how to navigate my interactions with the
jerks, I’m pretty sure he offered up a dismissive profanity to describe
what he thought of them.</p>

<p><em>Next time for real, we’ll talk about SPMD on SIMD and early design
 influences; it’ll be a little more cheery than this one turned out to be. It’ll be
 the posting</em> after <em>that before we get to the first reveal of results to the
 compiler team.</em></p>
