    <p>It wasn’t quite fair to describe volta as a dumb compiler
<a href="/matt/blog/2018/04/21/ispc-volta-c-and-spmd.html#compiler-optimizations-versus-transformations">earlier</a>; we’ll revisit
that topic today.</p>

<p>Not only were a number of the language features carefully designed to map
well to CPU hardware, but a number of custom optimization passes for LLVM
IR turned out to be important for keeping performance competitive with
intrinsics.  Many of them were influenced by the early users at Intel and
their close scrutiny of volta’s assembly output.</p>

<h2 id="uniform">Uniform</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> qualifier is one of the most important language features for
performance.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> is a type qualifier that describes a value that’s the same across
all of the SPMD program instances being executed.  It corresponds to a
scalar value and maps nicely to the CPU, which I’m told supports scalar
computation as well as SIMD.  The concept has been an easy one for
programmers to pick up and has a direct mapping to how CPU
intrinsics programmers structure their code.</p>

<p>Declaring a variable to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> can give two benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any control flow based on a uniform value is just like control flow
in regular programs: all of the SPMD program instances follow the same
path, and we don’t need to worry about updating the execution mask.</li>
  <li>Memory access of uniform values is easy to handle and efficient: for
example, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> read corresponds to a simple scalar load.</li>
</ul>

<p>My first exposure to the general idea of <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> came from the RenderMan
Shading Language (RSL), which turns out to be a SPMD language that operates
on grids of points to be shaded.  It also has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> keyword,
signifying a value that is the same for all points.  As far as I know, RSL
implementations never targeted SIMD CPU hardware, but scalar CPU
implementations maintained a mask of which points were active and could
apply <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> for similar benefits for control flow.  Closing the circle,
it was fun when Pixar posted a <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/resources/RenderMan_20/portingRSLtoC.html">note about the benefits of using ispc
for
shaders</a>
a few years ago.</p>

<p>It turns out that RSL had originally been designed for custom SIMD hardware
in the 1980s, and it also turns out there were precursors to <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code> in
other SPMD languages of that era that targeted multiprocessors; again, see
the <a href="/matt/papers/ispc_inpar_2012.pdf">ispc paper</a> for more
on previous work in this area.</p>

<h2 id="minimizing-masked-instructions">Minimizing masked instructions</h2>

<p>Handling the all details of masked vector computation can cause a fair
amount of bloat in x86 assembly.  It turned out to be worthwhile to design
some of volta’s language features to make it possible to foster situations
where the compiler could determine that all of the program
instances were active and take advantage of that in code generation.</p>

<p>One example of that is a specialized loop construct that volta provides,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">foreach</code>.<sup id="fnref:foreach"><a href="#fn:foreach" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It describes a loop over one or more dimensions where
SPMD program instances are mapped to a given range of values.</p>

<p>We’ll use this short volta function as an example in the following;
presumably it’s obvious what it does:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>void increment(uniform float ptr[], uniform int count) {
    foreach (i = 0 ... count) {
        ptr[i] += 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Consider now a <code class="highlighter-rouge">foreach</code> loop over 130 values with an 8-wide SIMD target:
there will be 16 loop iterations where the execution mask is all on that
take care of the first 128 values.  Then, there will be a single iteration at
the end with a mixed mask for the ragged extra two elements.  ispc/volta
generates two versions of the code for the loop body, the first one
specialized for an all-on mask.</p>

<p>Modern ispc generates this AVX2 assembly for the unmasked iterations, plus
the extra few instructions to see if another loop iteration is needed and
then jump to the appropriate place:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	vaddps	(%rdi,%rdx), %ymm0, %ymm1
	vmovups	%ymm1, (%rdi,%rdx)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Just what you’d want, unless you’re the sort of person who’s bothered by a
possibly-unnecessary use of an unaligned vector store.  Assuming <code class="highlighter-rouge">count</code> is
large, the vast majority of iterations will just run that code.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more that has to be done in the general case.  Here’s the
code for the last iteration:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	vmovd        %eax, %xmm0
	vpbroadcastd %xmm0, %ymm0
	vpaddd       LCPI0_1(%rip), %ymm0, %ymm0
	vmovd        %esi, %xmm1
	vpbroadcastd %xmm1, %ymm1
	vpcmpgtd     %ymm0, %ymm1, %ymm0
	shll         $2, %eax
	cltq
	vmaskmovps   (%rdi,%rax), %ymm0, %ymm1
	vbroadcastss LCPI0_0(%rip), %ymm2
	vaddps       %ymm2, %ymm1, %ymm1
	vmaskmovps   %ymm1, %ymm0, (%rdi,%rax)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first handful of instructions determine the execution mask, disabling
the vector lanes that correspond to entries in the array past <code class="highlighter-rouge">count</code>.
Then it’s necessary to use that mask with a masked load instruction,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">vmaskmovps</code>, when loading the last values from the array so that we don’t
accidentally read memory past the end of it. Then there’s the add.  Then
finally, a masked store when writing the results back so that we don’t
clobber memory after the array.</p>

<p>Without <code class="highlighter-rouge">foreach</code> and the “all on” optimizations that it enabled, we’d be
going through a lot of that each time through the loop.  (And the
intrinsics programmers would rightly roll their eyes and walk away.)</p>

<p>If you know that the number of items you have to process is always a
multiple of the SIMD width, you can add something like this before the
loop:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>count &amp;= ~7;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’d be no-op in practice, but it’s enough to let the compiler be able to
figure out that it doesn’t need to emit the second version of the loop body
if it won’t be needed.<sup id="fnref:comp"><a href="#fn:comp" class="footnote">2</a></sup> (By the “compiler”, I mean LLVM in this case;
ispc goes ahead and emits IR for both cases but after LLVM’s regular
optimization passes have done their thing, LLVM’s dead code elimination pass
takes care of business.)</p>

<p>There are other places beyond <code class="highlighter-rouge">foreach</code> where we can do similar things.
When an application first calls from C/C++ to volta code, by definition all
of the program instances are running, so the execution mask can statically
be determined to be all on until SPMD control flow enters the picture.
Until then, the same sorts of optimizations can also be applied.</p>

<p>Furthermore, not all’s lost when SPMD control flow starts happening: it can
be worthwhile to check at runtime whether all of the program instances are
active.  volta/ispc provides separate control flow keywords that allow the
programmer to indicate expected-to-be-coherent control flow: <code class="highlighter-rouge">cif</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cfor</code>,
and so forth.</p>

<p>As an example, when <code class="highlighter-rouge">cif</code> is used, volta/ispc generates code that tests the
execution mask right after updating it for the effect of the ‘if’ condition.  If
it’s all on, then we can jump to a specialized code path that starts with the “mask
all on” assumption. If it’s all off, then we can directly jump until after
the ‘if’ statement’s body. Otherwise we have to execute the if’s code with regular
masking, as regular <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> does.  There’s obviously a cost from <code class="highlighter-rouge">cif</code> in terms
of code duplication, but for the cases where all of the program instances
are in fact active, it can give a meaningful performance benefit.</p>

<p>I felt it was important to make that an explicit language feature, rather
than not introducing new keywords and trying to figure out reasonable
heuristics for an optimizer to decide when to add that check and when not
to.  It’s admittedly a little extra mental overhead for the programmer and
I’m sure that there are cases where people write ispc code without using
those that would benefit from them, but again it’s a case where I’d prefer
that the compiler be straightforward and predictable in the code that it
generates; another case of focusing on the performance-oriented programmer
as the most important type of user.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-spmd-loads-and-stores">Efficient SPMD loads and stores</h2>

<p>Loads and stores from SPMD programs running on SIMD hardware are
“interesting”.  In general, each program instance in the vector may be
reading from or writing to completely different locations in memory.
Further, some of them may be inactive, and must not issue reads or writes
at all in that case.  (We saw a bit of this issue <a href="/matt/blog/2018/04/23/ispc-volta-users-and-ooo.html#ode-to-modern-cpus">earlier when we looked
at implementing
scatter</a>.)</p>

<p>In general, we need to issue a gather instruction for a SPMD read and a
scatter for a write; these allow full flexibility in the memory locations accessed.
Even if these are available as native instructions (as they are in
AVX-512), performance is much better if we use vector loads and stores in the
cases where the memory locations accessed are contiguous—it’s better to
only use gather and scatter when we really need it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we need to make this decision at compile time.  With GPUs
(as I understand how they work these days), all of this is pretty much a
run time distinction: the compiler just emits the equivalent of a gather or
scatter and then the actual performance at run time depends whether the
locations accessed were coherent in various ways or not.  (Avoiding bank
conflicts and all that.)  That’s much better, since the locations accessed are
in general data-dependent and thus their coherence can never be known as
well at compile-time as at run-time.</p>

<p>That’s not how CPUs work, so we’ll have to do our best in the
compiler.</p>

<p>The volta front-end doesn’t at all try to be clever about this; other than
scalar memory accesses through <code class="highlighter-rouge">uniform</code>s, it starts out by just generating
tentative gathers and scatters for all SPMD reads and writes.  volta declares a
whole bunch of <code class="highlighter-rouge">pseudo</code> gather and scatter functions in LLVM IR, for
example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>declare &lt;WIDTH x float&gt; @__pseudo_gather64_float(&lt;WIDTH x i64&gt;,
    &lt;WIDTH x MASK&gt;) nounwind readonly
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(<code class="highlighter-rouge">WITDH</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">MASK</code> get set to concrete values via a macro expansion step.)</p>

<p>Then, for any SPMD memory read of floats (e.g. loading a SIMD vector’s
worth of values in that <code class="highlighter-rouge">increment()</code> example above), on a 64-bit target,
volta emits a call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">__pseudo_gather64_float</code>, providing a unique pointer
for each SIMD lane as well as the execution mask.</p>

<p>Those pseudo functions are left undefined through early LLVM optimization
passes.  In time, custom volta optimization passes start trying to improve
them.  There’s a lot that can be done better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If all of the pointers have the same value, volta substitutes a scalar load and
vector broadcast.</li>
  <li>If the SPMD instances can be determined to be reading contiguous memory
locations (as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">increment()</code>), it uses vector load.</li>
  <li>If a gather truly is necessary, or the compiler can’t be sure, then a gather it is.
(And then the target-specific IR will either emit a native instruction or
do the equivalent with a series of instructions.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish all the complexity around doing that wasn’t necessary, but it’s a
significant performance cliff if a gather or scatter is emitted
unnecessarily, so it was worth banging on it a lot.  In the end, those
optimization passes got a lot of attention and came to be pretty robust at
detecting the appropriate patterns, which I think is the best that could be
hoped for.</p>

<p>Later on, I spent some time implementing some slightly more sophisticated
approaches to avoiding gathers for reads that could be better expressed as
vector loads and shuffles.  Consider this function:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>void reduce(uniform float ptr[], uniform float result[], uniform int count) {
    foreach (i = 0 ... count) {
        result[i] = ptr[i/2];
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On an 8-wide target, it’d be better to issue a 4-wide load and do a vector
shuffle—much faster than a gather.  For a function like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>void deinterleave(uniform float ptr[], uniform float a[],
                  uniform float b[], uniform int count) {
    foreach (i = 0 ... count) {
        a[i] = ptr[2*i];
        b[i] = ptr[2*i + 1];
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>an experienced intrinsics programmer would use two vector loads and then
some shuffles.  Trying that with modern ispc, a gather is emitted; I swear
those used to be taken care of by that optimization.  Another little thing
to dig into later.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the end, all this added up to about 6k LOC for <a href="https://github.com/ispc/ispc/blob/master/opt.cpp">custom LLVM
optimization passes in
ispc</a>; so maybe the
compiler wasn’t completely dumb after all.  There isn’t too much deep
compiler magic in all that, however, which I think makes the output of the
compiler still fairly predictable.</p>
