    <p><em>I’ve decided to write up a little history of
<a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ispc</a>, the compiler I wrote when I was at Intel.
There’s a lot to say, so it’ll come out in a series of posts over the next
few weeks.  While I’ve tried to get all the details right and properly
credit people, this is all from my memory.  For anyone who was around at
the time, please send an email if you see any factual errors.</em></p>

<h2 id="elegy-for-larrabee">Elegy for Larrabee</h2>

<p>To understand the origins of ispc, it’s helpful to know a little bit about
Larrabee.  Larrabee (LRB) was Intel’s foray into building a high-end GPU.
The project spanned roughly 2005 to 2010.  After years of graphics being
allotted years-old semiconductor process lines and tiny amounts of chip
area, Intel was going to go big with Larrabee: GPUs on PCI-Express cards,
the leading semiconductor process, competing for real at the high end, with
the goal of being competitive with AMD and NVIDIA.</p>

<p>Intel executives fell in love with Larrabee because it was based on
x86. “See, x86 <em>can</em> do anything! We don’t need to build some weird GPU
architecture to be successful in graphics,” is what I’m sure they all told
themselves.  It was a seductive pitch, and on the face of it, it seemed
reasonable.  Just add a big vector unit on each core, add some texture
units, have some programmer person write some code, and next thing you
know, you’re selling more high-margin chips, putting the hurt on NVIDIA and
their GPU computing ambitions to boot.  (And the idea of LRB did seem
reasonable to me for quite a long time, too, though I didn’t have quite the
same attachment to the ISA and CPU architecture as the rest of the company
did culturally.)</p>

<p>There are many reasons Larrabee didn’t work out and perhaps I’ll write
something about my take on that at some point. (In the meantime, Tom
Forsyth has a <a href="http://tomforsyth1000.github.io/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BWhy%20didn%27t%20Larrabee%20fail%3F%5D%5D">nice writeup about his views on this
topic</a>
that’s worth checking out.)</p>

<p>One of the big problems was that there was a 16-wide vector unit on each
core, yet there was no good way to write code that actually used it other
than the shader compiler that was being written just for DX and OpenGL.  If
you’re not lighting up the vector units, you’re running at 1/16th of
Larrabee’s potential performance; at that point, you’d be better running on
a smaller number of regular CPU cores, sporting higher clock rates,
out-of-order execution, bigger caches, and all that.</p>

<p>I saw one of the LRB hardware architects go out time and time again
and tell developers that LRB was great because they could just program in C
as usual, but now get multiple TFLOPs of performance, just from recompiling
their pre-existing code.</p>

<p>We’d all try to explain to the hardware architects who believed that it
would just take a recompile that it wasn’t quite that easy and sure,
although multi-threading was pretty well understood by programmers, you
still needed something for the vector unit and in all honesty, for that
there was nothing.  The usual response was a few head nods with slightly
glazed eyes—agreement that ok, maybe it wasn’t quite that simple, but how
hard could it actually be?  It was quite a contrast to the panic that many
software folks were starting to experience.</p>

<p>In general, the Intel hardware architects knew remarkably little about
programming (that Forsyth fellow notwithstanding), and I’m sure those that
thought that way really believed it. (To be fair, I don’t know much about
actually <em>doing</em> HW architecture, though I guess I’m not out telling the
hardware architects bogus things about how best to implement a branch
predictor.)</p>

<p>The Intel compiler team assured the hardware architects that they had it
all under control.  They had the best loop vectorizer in the
business—once they wrote a new backend for LRB, we’d be all set. C, C++,
and even Fortran programmers would be able to light up those 16 vector
lanes with ease, not needing to even think about it.  (Just for
calibration, it was a point of pride for them that Intel had the best
Fortran compiler in the business as well.)</p>

<p>And there were a few folks who were thrilled to write intrinsics—Mike
Abrash and the other great programmers at RAD who were writing the
rasterizer wanted little more than that, and Tim Sweeney was salivating at
the possibilities.  I imagine that fact that they were so cool with the
intrinsics option made the hardware architects think those of us sounding
the alarm were just not very good programmers and thus not worth worrying
about.  (And to be clear, I’m a lousy programmer compared to Mike
Abrash. And Tim Sweeney.)
But building programmable hardware that only 5 people in the world can
program ain’t a winning strategy, I’d humbly suggest.</p>

<p>In the end, it wasn’t the lack of a compiler for the vector units that
doomed LRB: the hardware was late, the software rasterizer was late, and
the whole project was caught out by the market transition to a world where
power efficiency was much more important than it had been a few years
before—consumers wanted mobile and battery-powered computing, and the LRB
architecture was less power efficient than a conventional GPU architecture.</p>

<p>So LRB came to an end, but at least we’ve got AVX-512 on (some) CPUs now.
From the LRB experience, though, it became clear to quite a few of us there
at the time that this vector unit issue was an important one to address, if
only for CPUs, where more and more processing was becoming available
through SIMD.</p>

<h2 id="lets-solve-this-together-with-the-compiler-team">Let’s solve this together with the compiler team!</h2>

<p>Steeped in generating great code for regular loops that performed dense
matrix math, for a long time most of the Intel compiler team denied that
anything more than their auto-vectorizer was needed to take care of vector
unit utilization.  We quickly fell into a cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’d inform the graphics folks that they’d improved their
auto-vectorizer in response to our requests and that it did everything we
had asked for.</li>
  <li>We’d try it and find that though it was better, boy was it
easy to write code that wasn’t actually compiled to vector code—it’d fail unpredictably.</li>
  <li>We’d give them failing cases, a few months would would pass and they’d
inform us that the latest version solved the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>It didn’t take much to fall off the vectorization path.  They tried to
patch things up at first but eventually they threw up their hands and came
up with <code class="highlighter-rouge">#pragma simd</code>, which would disable the “is it safe to vectorize
this” checks in the auto-vectorizer and vectorize the following loop no
matter what.  (Once a <code class="highlighter-rouge">#pragma</code> is proposed to solve a hard problem, you
know things aren’t in a good place.)</p>

<p>So there was <code class="highlighter-rouge">#pragma simd</code>, which sort of worked, unless you called an
external function; that problem never got solved.  They never understood
why someone would want to write a large system that ran completely using
all of the vector lanes and couldn’t imagine it was an important use case.
(The attentive reader may realize that this execution model precisely
describes GPUs.)</p>

<h2 id="auto-vectorization-is-not-a-programming-model">Auto-vectorization is not a programming model</h2>

<p>I think that the fatal flaw with the approach the compiler team was trying
to make work was best diagnosed by <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~tfoley/">T.
Foley</a>, who’s full of great insights
about this stuff: <em>auto-vectorization is not a programming model</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with an auto-vectorizer is that as long as vectorization can
fail (and it will), then if you’re a programmer who actually cares about
what code the compiler generates for your program, you must come to deeply
understand the auto-vectorizer.  Then, when it fails to vectorize code you
want to be vectorized, you can either poke
it in the right ways or change your program in the right ways so that it
works for you again.  This is a horrible way to program; it’s all alchemy
and guesswork and you need to become deeply specialized about the nuances of a
single compiler’s implementation—something you wouldn’t otherwise need to
care about one bit.</p>

<p>And God help you when they release a new version of the compiler with
changes to the auto-vectorizer’s implementation.</p>

<p>With a proper programming model, then the programmer learns the model
(which is hopefully fairly clean), one or more compilers implement it, the
generated code is predictable (no performance cliffs), and everyone’s
happy.</p>

<p>Along the way, many graphics people at Intel tried to explain to people in
the compiler team that there were interesting things in GPU programming
models that they might do well to understand and that those ideas could be
profitably applied to not just to LRB, but to general CPU vector
programming as well.</p>

<p>These interesting things boiled down to the SPMD programming model,
familiar to GPU programmers both from shaders and languages like CUDA: you
write code that mostly looks like it’s serial, just describing a
computation on a single data element (vertex, pixel, etc.). In turn, that
code is run in parallel on the hardware with many different inputs—many
vertices are transformed at once, many pixels are shaded together, etc.</p>

<p>In this model, the parallelism is <em>implicit</em>. For the most part, the
programmer only needs to think about operating on one piece of data, and
doesn’t need to worry about how their program is mapped to hardware.  (It
isn’t always that simple in CUDA and in more recent versions of DirectX and
OpenGL, but it’s mostly true.)  Parallel execution is handled
automatically, and as long as you provide the GPU with enough independent
work to do, you can get great parallel utilization.</p>

<p>As graphics programmers have learned, SPMD is a really nice way to write
high-performance parallel code.  Sure, it doesn’t have serial semantics like code
that the auto-vectorizer starts with, and serial semantics are great as
long as they don’t inhibit performance, but as far as parallel programming
models go, SPMD is conceptually clean and fairly easy to compile to SIMD
hardware.  (More on that point later.)  Most programmers writing shaders
don’t need to think about the fact that their programs are parallel at all.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-really-a-vectorization-problem-you-see">It’s not really a vectorization problem, you see…</h2>

<p>Looking back, I think the Intel compiler folks were thinking about the
problem wrong, and we graphics folks failed to bridge the gap to get them
to see it how we did.  (But boy did we try.)  To them, this was an outer
loop vectorization problem: you’re not vectorizing inner loops, you’re just
vectorizing the outer-most loop of your program.  While that is in a sense
an accurate description of the problem, it always seemed to me a strange
way to think of it. (It misses, for example, the notion of communication
between multiple running program instances that can be expressed in some
SPMD models.)</p>

<p>The flaw with this mindset became clear from one nit that one of their lead
architects kept coming back to in these discussions: “what happens when the
CUDA compiler fails to vectorize?”  He was baffled about how this problem
was handled in CUDA.  One had the sense that he felt that if he could just
understand that, then that would be the key to fixing Intel’s
auto-vectorizer and making us go away.</p>

<p>Of course, CUDA does not vectorize at all, and so CUDA never fails to
vectorize; the question made no sense.  You write your program, and
although it looks mostly serial, it can and will run in parallel on the
GPU, because that’s the programming model and it maps nicely to the
hardware. Done and done.</p>

<p>We really tried to explain, multiple times, but the explanations never stuck.</p>

<p>In a meeting soon afterward, this same person angrily told us, “I don’t
tell Toyota how to design a car; I might request features, but then
designing it is their job.”  He and others grew tired of the graphics
people trying to tell them how they might improve their vector programming
model and that their current one was insufficient for the kinds of programs
we wanted to write. We all grew tired of saying the same things over and
over without making any headway; at that point, it seemed impossible to
convince them to do something about it.</p>

<p><em>Stay tuned for the next installment, feat. a summer in Sweden and some
goofing around with LLVM that started to get interesting.</em></p>
