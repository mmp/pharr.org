    <p>After the first push to github, there were bug fixes (thankfully none too
embarrassing) and pull requests; it all seemed to be going well.  The start
of support for AVX2 landed in ispc in December 2011; it looks like it was
enabled in January 2012, but support for AVX2’s gather and FMA didn’t land
until that summer.  (I think that may have been waiting for LLVM support
for those, but am not sure.)</p>

<p>In the summer of 2012, Jean-Luc Duprat started work on ispc support for
Knight’s Corner (KNC), a HPC-focused architecture based on Larrabee that
was the first product in the Xeon Phi series.  Jean-Luc, a former graphics
person who well understood SPMD, had become a KNC architect and wanted to
have the ispc functionality there.  Lacking an LLVM backend for KNC, he
implemented a clever approach based on using LLVM’s C++ backend to emit C++
intrinsics code.  Given the right <a href="https://github.com/ispc/ispc/blob/master/examples/intrinsics/knc.h">header
file</a>,
that could be compiled the rest of the way to assembly.  A hack, but in the
best kind of way.<sup id="fnref:ingo"><a href="#fn:ingo" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="c-and-writing-it-up">C++ and writing it up</h2>

<p>Bill Mark got interested in working through the details of what it would
take to propose an addition to the C++ standard for SPMD computation; he’s
an incredible system designer and was great at thinking deeply about the
details.  Over many months, we had many long conversations about the
language design and its relation to C++; in the end, he came up with a
fairly comprehensive design for C++ extensions which he called “Sierra”.
Figuring out the right design for pointers in ispc came out of those
discussions; it turned out to be a <a href="http://ispc.github.io/ispc.html#pointer-types">bit
subtle</a>.</p>

<p>An intern implemented a <a href="http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/papers/lhwmp_sierra.pdf">prototype of those ideas in
clang</a>, with good
initial results; clang’s clean design made that relatively straightforward.
It was really neat to see things like lambdas and templates just working
with SPMD on SIMD code.  Many of the ideas from Bill’s design later
appeared in <a href="http://compilers.cs.uni-saarland.de/papers/lhh14.pdf">this
paper</a>.</p>

<p>Bill and I wrote a <a href="/matt/papers/ispc_inpar_2012.pdf">paper</a> about ispc
in 2012.  I think it well captures the system’s design and implementation
considerations and it has thorough discussion of previous SPMD languages
that turned out to have a lot in common with ispc.  We published it at
InPar, a new conference on parallel computation that year.</p>

<p>InPar was co-located with NVIDIA’s GTC, which in turn meant there was a
heavy GPU focus.  And by “heavy GPU focus”, I mean our paper was the only
one about CPUs.  Yet, with strong audience support, we won the best paper
award.  Our prize was a top of the line NVIDIA GPU.</p>

<h2 id="talking-to-the-academics">Talking to the academics</h2>

<p>Among the ways Geoff Lowney was a great help was in getting me set up to
give a few external talks on ispc to academic researchers.  One of these
led to a two-day visit to Illinois to give a talk at UIUC.</p>

<p>I spent the morning of the first day with a bunch of people in Intel’s
Champaign-Urbana office, which was fantastic—smart, open-minded and
interesting folks.  I then got to go have lunch with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kuck">David
Kuck</a>, which was great, too.  It
turns out that he knows a thing or two about parallel programming.</p>

<p>There was one slight hitch: apparently there was an issue with the chicken
in the chicken salad at lunch; food poisoning ensued, and I spent the rest
of the afternoon and evening in my hotel room, not in a good state, and
overall freaking out about how things would go at the university the next
day.  Successfully making it through hour plus standing in front of an
audience while also speaking cogently seemed quite iffy.</p>

<p>Even when not ill, I always worried about talking to compiler researchers
about ispc; compilers is not my area and I worried about my incomplete
knowledge of the previous work.  I imagined my explaining the idea to a
professor and then their saying “Oh, that’s the Hazenburger transformation,
first described in 1975.  My undergrad compiler class implemented it for an
assignment last week. Is there anything else to what you’ve done?”</p>

<p>Um, no—that’s it.  (By now I’ve gotten pretty comfortable that there
isn’t a Hazenburger transformation after all.)</p>

<p>I’d been a little extra nervous about the UIUC talk because <a href="http://vikram.cs.illinois.edu/">Vikram
Adve</a> was on the faculty there and would be
in attendance.  Not only was he a renowned compiler researcher, he’d been
Chris Lattner’s Ph.D. adviser; LLVM got off the ground at UIUC.  So there
was even more potential for public embarrassment in my imagined worst case,
now with the added worry about whether I’d be fully recovered from the food
poisoning.  Right before the talk, I scouted out the nearest bathroom, just
so I’d know where to run in an emergency.</p>

<p>To my relief, the talk went well.  Vikram was really nice, and we had a
nice chat afterward; he seemed to find the ideas intriguing.  The talk was
recorded, but link seems to be broken.  It’s probably just as well; I can
avoid the awkwardness of watching myself on video.  The
<a href="http://i2pc.cs.illinois.edu/public_archive/uiuc-ispc-2012.pdf">slides</a> are
still online; they give a flavor of where things stood at that point and
what the general message was.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, giving the talk at a parallel computing lab at another
university didn’t go as well.  It was a bad omen when the faculty member
who was supposed to introduce me didn’t show up until 20 minutes after the
talk was support to start.  After standing around awkwardly for 10 minutes
waiting for someone to kick this thing off, I finally just introduced
myself and started the talk.</p>

<p>During the Q&amp;A after the talk, one of the grad students was insistent that
a 180x speedup on a 40 core machine that I reported in my results was
purely due to multi-threading and how could I be <em>sure</em> that SIMD had
anything to do with it?  Also, it turns out that there’s not a single
interesting workload that isn’t massively-parallel and runs well on GPUs,
and therefore there wasn’t anything interesting about making things run
fast on CPUs.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a relief when the faculty member who had invited me to give
the talk told me that he hadn’t gotten around to setting up any meetings
with the researchers in the lab after the talk, as had been part of the
original invitation.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-intel">Leaving Intel</h2>

<p>It’s funny how it all ended.</p>

<p>For a long time, I’d strenuously avoided building a group to work on ispc;
plenty of other people engaged, pitched in, and made critical contributions
along the way—T. Foley, Bill Mark, Jean-Luc, and many others.  They were
all in different organizations, contributing on their own volition, to the
extent of the time they could and wanted to make available.</p>

<p>Not trying to formalize things beyond that was a defensive maneuver. An
organized group of people working on ispc would have presented a better
target for attack: if I got headcount and hired people to build up a group
devoted to ispc, we might work productively for a while.  In time, though,
the jerks would likely apply their well-honed maneuver of persuading
management that those people could be better used working on something else
that was more important.  If successful, then poof, everyone’s sent away to
join another group and the project disintegrates—their actual goal.</p>

<p>With it being just me, there wasn’t much of a target.</p>

<p>In the Fall of 2012, I went ahead and asked Geoff Lowney for just one
person’s headcount to help me with ispc.  Not too much bigger a target, and
it was a good time to start work on serious support for AVX-512; there was
plenty to do on that front.  He readily went off to make it happen.  A
few days later, as he told me it was no problem, I felt… terror.</p>

<p>Especially after ispc was open sourced, I’d been able to be fairly
carefree: the compiler was out there in the world, it was working well, and
people liked it.  I could keep on working on it basically on a day by day
basis.  If things got weird at Intel—politics, some bad reorg,
whatever—I knew I could just leave without leaving behind much unfinished
business.  I’d never planned to stay at Intel for the rest of my career, so
I figured I’d stick around as long as it was more fun than not, and leave
when the right time came.</p>

<p>But bringing someone on to join the project?  Then I’d be responsible for
them, having to do my part to shield them from the politics.  Worse, I’d no
longer have the option to leave Intel anytime soon—it wouldn’t have been
fair to that person, especially since most likely they’d be reorged away
into something else if I left.  I realized that adding someone to the
effort was effectively signing myself on to stay for at least another year
or two.</p>

<p>Given all of the previous ups and downs, I wasn’t ready to commit to that.
Thinking about it more, it seemed like it was probably a good time to move
on; ispc was in good shape and nothing major was missing.  Continuing to
turn the crank didn’t have a lot of appeal.</p>

<p>So I quit, for real that time.  Geoff was a bit surprised when I explained
why—that his giving me the headcount I had asked for in the first place
was what led me to see it was the right time to leave—but he was
impressively cool about it.  My last commit with an Intel email address was
September 14, 2012.</p>
