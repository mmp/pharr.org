    <p>I’ve been a long-time skeptic about ray tracing for interactive rendering.
Whenever the topic’s come up, I’ve always been on the side of “I wish, but
it just doesn’t make sense for real-time rendering”.  It’s certainly not
that I don’t like ray tracing, but for a long time, I felt that most of the
arguments that were made in favor of it never really stood up to close
scrutiny.</p>

<p>I don’t want to go through all of them (in part because smoke will start to
come out of my ears), but just to mention a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Rasterization is a hack</em>. This is the worst one. Rasterization is a
wonderfully efficient algorithm for computing visibility from a single
viewpoint.  That’s an awfully useful thing.  And by the way, for the past 30
years, it’s done that robustly, without cracks along shared triangle
edges—something that has just <a href="http://jcgt.org/published/0002/01/05/">recently been
solved</a> for ray tracing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Rasterization is only fast because it has dedicated hardware</em>. The
implication being that ray tracing could be just as fast, just given a few
transistors.  This one misses the substantial advantages of coherent and
limited memory access with rasterization (both texture and framebuffer) and
ignores the substantial computational advantages of computing
visibility from a single viewpoint rather than from arbitrary viewpoints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Ray tracing has O(log n) time complexity while rasterization is O(n) so
it wins for sufficiently complex scenes</em>.  Apparently, the fact that culling
and LOD can be and is applied with rasterization renderers is not
universally understood.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, ray tracing does offer something special: because it can answer
arbitrary visibility queries (“is there an occluder between two arbitrary
points” or “what’s the first object visible from an arbitrary point in an
arbitrary direction”), it’s well suited to computing global illumination
and illumination from large area light sources using Monte Carlo
integration.  Both of those lighting effects are hard to simulate with a
rasterizer because the visibility computations required are inherently
incoherent.</p>

<p>As desirable as they are, these effects come with two big challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The rays to be traced are incoherent.  Many of the early interactive ray
tracing demos mostly traced coherent rays, starting at the camera or ending
at a point light source.  These can be traced much more efficiently than
arbitrary rays, using techniques like packet tracing, frustum tracing, and
the like. Impressive early ray-tracing demos with coherent rays gave a
misleading sense of what the performance would be with incoherent rays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get good results for global illumination and complex lighting, you
generally need to trace hundreds of rays per pixel.  Even today, graphics
hardware can deliver maybe a handful of rays traced per pixel—nowhere
near as many as are needed for a noise-free result.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To me, it seemed like it would be a long time before the gap between what
the hardware could deliver and what was needed for high-quality interactive
ray-traced images would ever close.<sup id="fnref:caustic"><a href="#fn:caustic" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Given the slowing of Moore’s
law, I feared it might never close.  Therefore, I always believed that it
was reasonable to just use additional transistors and computational
capability for programmable GPU compute rather than for ray tracing.</p>

<p>And that was fine; the world’s real-time graphics programmers have shown an
amazing ability to make use of more computation in the rasterization
context.  Ray tracing doesn’t <em>have</em> to be used everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="things-they-are-a-changing">Things they are a-changing</h2>

<p>At a gathering at SIGGRAPH last year, I heard <a href="http://graphicrants.blogspot.com/">Brian
Karis</a> casually say that obviously
path-tracing was the future of real-time graphics.  It was the first time
I’d heard a legit world-class game developer say that sort of thing.  I’d
heard others agree “sure, we’d trace rays if it was free” when prodded by
the real-time ray-tracing evangelists, but that’s a whole different thing
than saying “this is the future, I want this, and it’s going to happen”.
The comment stuck with me, though I imagined it was a long-term view,
rather than something that would start happening soon.</p>

<p>But then one of the most exciting recent developments in ray-tracing has
been the rapid advancement of deep convnet-based denoisers; among others,
researchers at
<a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/library/MLDenoisingB/index.html">Pixar</a> and
<a href="http://research.nvidia.com/publication/interactive-reconstruction-monte-carlo-image-sequences-using-recurrent-denoising">NVIDIA</a>
have done really impressive work in this area.  Out of nowhere, we now have
the prospect of being able to generate high-quality images with just a
handful of samples per pixel.  There’s still much more work to be done, but
the results so far have been stunning.</p>

<p>And then Marco Salvi’s fantastic SIGGRAPH talk on <a href="http://openproblems.realtimerendering.com/s2017/05-msalvi-dl-future-of-rendering.pptx">deep learning and the
future of real time
rendering</a>
really got the gears turning in my head; there’s a lot more beyond just
denoising that deep learning has to offer graphics.</p>

<p>Finally, on top of all that there was the excitement of the announcement of
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/directx/2018/03/19/announcing-microsoft-directx-raytracing/">DXR</a>
at GDC this year, accompanied by ridiculously beautiful demos from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXo0WdlELJk">SEED</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ue35ago3Y&amp;feature=youtu.be">Epic</a>.  Ray
tracing a first-class thing in the DX API, now something that graphics
hardware vendors have reason to start working on accelerating: I had no
idea any of that was in the pipeline and was floored by all of it as I saw
it.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/seed.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/seed">SEED</a>’s gorgeous ray tracing demo.</em></p>

<p>Put it all together, and now I’m a convert: I think all of the pieces are
there for real-time ray tracing to happen for real, in a way that will be
truly useful for developers.</p>

<h2 id="joining-nvidia">Joining NVIDIA</h2>

<p>I believe that real-time rendering will be largely reinvented over the next
few years: still with plenty of rasterization, but now with not just one,
but two really exciting new tools in the toolbox—neural nets and ray
tracing.  I think that rapid progress will come as we revisit the
algorithms used for real-time rendering and reconsider them in light of
the capabilities of those new tools.</p>

<p>I wanted to be in the thick of all of that and to help contribute to it
actually happening.  Therefore, last Friday was my last day working at
Google.  I’m in the middle of a three-day spell of unemployment and will
be starting at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/">NVIDIA Research</a>
joining the real-time rendering group on Tuesday.  I can’t wait to get
started.</p>

<p>There are tons of interesting questions to dig into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can other graphics algorithms be improved using neural nets or other
techniques from machine learning?</li>
  <li>When rendering, when do you trace more rays and when do you use more neural nets?</li>
  <li>Can we sample better by having neural nets decide which rays to trace and
not just reconstruct the final images?</li>
  <li>What’s the right balance between on-line learning based on the specific
scene and training ahead of time?</li>
  <li>What does all this change mean for GPU architectures—how many
transistors should spent on dense matrix multiply (neural net evaluation),
how many specialized for ray tracing (and how), and how
many on general purpose compute?</li>
  <li>How do you make that hardware friendly to programmers?</li>
  <li>What’s the right way implement complex graphics
systems that are half neural nets and half conventional graphics
computation?</li>
  <li>How do you debug complex graphics systems that are half-learned?</li>
</ul>

<p>Given how much progress on these fronts has already been made at NVIDIA, I
think many of the solutions will be worked out there in the coming years.
There’s a veritable dream team of rendering folks there—many of whom I’ve
really enjoyed working with previously and many others who I’ve always
wanted to have the chance to work with.  Add to that hardware architects
who have consistently been at the forefront of GPU architectures for nearly
twenty years, and it’s hard to imagine a more exciting place to be for this
chapter in computer graphics.</p>
