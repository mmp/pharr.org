    <p>Today we’ll look at two more places where pbrt was spending a lot of time
when parsing Disney’s <em>Moana</em> island scene and see what we can do to
improve performance there.  With those taken care of, we’ll wrap up, at
least for now and as far as what’s reasonable to do in pbrt-v3.  One last
posting in a few days will dig into how much farther we can go if we remove
the constraint of not making changes that would make the source code be too
different than the system described in <em>Physically Based Rendering</em>.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing-the-parser-itself">Optimizing the parser itself</h2>

<p>After the performance improvements from <a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/09/moana-island-pbrt-2.html">last
time</a>, the fraction of time
spent in pbrt’s parser, already significant at the beginning, naturally
went up. By now, it was by far where most time was spent during startup.</p>

<p>I finally bit the bullet and <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/commit/ea34ef7452601e53c3c3ade4cce11ec5e55e49d2">implemented a hand-written tokenizer and
parser</a>
for pbrt scenes.  The <a href="https://pbrt.org/fileformat-v3.html">pbrt scene file
format</a> is fairly easy to parse: quoted
strings aside, tokens are separated by white space and the grammar is very
straightforward (there’s never a need to look ahead more than one token),
but a custom parser was still about a thousand lines of code to write and
debug.  It helped to have lots of scenes to test with; after fixing the
outright crashes, I kept going until everything I had rendered exactly the
same images as before: there’s no excuse for any sort of pixel difference
solely from swapping out the parser. At that point, I was as confident as I
could be that I had it right.</p>

<p>I did my best to keep the new version efficient, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mmap()</code>ing input files
when possible and using a re-implementation of C++17’s
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view"><code class="highlighter-rouge">std::string_view</code></a>
to minimize making copies of strings from the file’s contents.  Also, because
<code class="highlighter-rouge">strtod()</code> had consumed a lot of time in earlier traces, I wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/blob/9f717d847a807793fa966cf0eaa366852efef167/src/core/parser.cpp#L320"><code class="highlighter-rouge">parseNumber()</code>
function</a>
with some care: single-digit integers and regular integers are handled
separately, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">strtof()</code> is used rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">strtod()</code> in the common
case when pbrt is compiled to use 32-bit floats.<sup id="fnref:str"><a href="#fn:str" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Throughout the implementation of the new parser, I was a little worried
that the old parser would be faster: after all, flex and bison have seen
years of development and optimization.  There was no way to know if all the
time I’d spent on writing a new one had been wasted until it was finished
and working correctly.</p>

<p>To my relief, the custom parser was a big win: flex and bison’s generality
brought along enough of a performance cost that the new version could
handily beat them.  With the new parser, startup time dropped to 13m 21s,
an incremental 1.5x speedup!  As an added bonus, all of the support for
flex and bison could then be removed from pbrt’s build system.  All that was
always a headache, especially on Windows, where most people don’t have
those installed by default.</p>

<h2 id="graphics-state-management">Graphics state management</h2>

<p>With the parser much faster, a new annoyance stuck out: at that point,
roughly 10% of setup time was spent in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pbrtAttributeBegin()</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pbrtAttributeEnd()</code> functions, and most of that time in dynamic memory
allocation and freeing.  Back during that first 35 minute run, those
functions used around 3% of the runtime, so weren’t anything to worry
about, but this is how it goes in the optimization business: once you start
knocking down the big things, the smaller things start to matter more.</p>

<p>pbrt’s scene description is based on a hierarchical graphics state, where
there’s a current transformation, a current material, and so forth, and
where you can snapshot the current state (<code class="highlighter-rouge">pbrtAttributeBegin()</code>), make
some changes to it before adding some shapes to the scene, and then pop
back to the original state (<code class="highlighter-rouge">pbrtAttributeEnd()</code>).</p>

<p>The graphics state is stored in a structure named… wait for
it… <code class="highlighter-rouge">GraphicsState</code>.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::vector</code> is used to store copies of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">GraphicsState</code> objects for the stack of saved graphics states.  Looking at
<code class="highlighter-rouge">GraphicsState</code>’s members suggested something to worry about—three
<code class="highlighter-rouge">std::map</code>s from names to instances of textures and materials:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct GraphicsState {
    // ...
    std::map&lt;std::string, std::shared_ptr&lt;Texture&lt;Float&gt;&gt;&gt; floatTextures;
    std::map&lt;std::string, std::shared_ptr&lt;Texture&lt;Spectrum&gt;&gt;&gt; spectrumTextures;
    std::map&lt;std::string, std::shared_ptr&lt;MaterialInstance&gt;&gt; namedMaterials;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Examining the scene files, I found that most instances of saving and
restoring graphics state were along these lines:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>AttributeBegin
    ConcatTransform [0.981262 0.133695 -0.138749 0.000000 -0.067901 0.913846 0.400343 0.000000 0.180319 -0.383420 0.905800 0.000000 11.095301 18.852249 9.481399 1.000000]
    ObjectInstance "archivebaycedar0001_mod"
AttributeEnd
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In other words: update the current transformation and instantiate an object
instance; no changes were made to the contents of any of those
<code class="highlighter-rouge">std::map</code>s.  Making a complete copy of them—allocating red-black tree
nodes, incrementing shared pointer reference counts, allocating space for
and copying strings—was almost always a waste, with all of that being
freed, unaccessed, when the previous graphics
state was restored.</p>

<p>I replaced each of those maps with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::shared_ptr</code> to a map and
implemented a copy-on-write approach, where a copy is made inside an
attribute begin/end block only if their contents need to be modified.  The
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/commit/65d90464ad30c83d8e7e256c6e0daddca0c6d7ca">change</a>
wasn’t too complicated, but it reduced startup time by just over a minute,
getting us to 12m 20s of processing before rendering began—an incremental
speedup of 1.08x.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-rendering-time">What about rendering time?</h2>

<p>The attentive reader will note that I haven’t said anything at all about
rendering time so far.  To my surprise, it’s been fairly tolerable out of
the box: pbrt can render film-resolution images of the scene with a few
hundred samples per pixel in two to three hours using twelve cores.  For
example, this image, one of the slower ones, renders in 2h 51m 36s:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/matt/blog/images/pbrt-moana-dunes.jpg" /> Moana
<i>island dunes rendered with <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3">pbrt-v3</a> at 2048x858 resolution
with 256 samples per pixel.  Total rendering time using a 12 core / 24
thread Google Compute Engine instance running at 2 GHz with the latest
version of pbrt-v3 was 2h 51m 36s.</i></p>

<p>That seems surprisingly reasonable to
me. I’m sure there’s room for improvement and that a closer look at where
time is being spent would reveal plenty of “interesting” things, but it
hasn’t yet been compelling to dig into that.</p>

<p>Looking at the profile, roughly 60% of rendering time is spent in
ray–object intersections (most of it in BVH traversal), and 25% is spent
in ptex texture lookups.  Those percentages are similar to what they are in
simpler scenes, so there’s nothing immediately obviously broken
there. (Though I’m sure that Embree could trace those rays in a bit less
time.)</p>

<p>Parallel scalability is not great, unfortunately.  I’m generally seeing
around 1400% CPU usage for rendering, compared to the 2400% ideal (on 24
virtual CPUs with Google Compute Engine).  The issue seems to be lock
contention in ptex, but I haven’t dug into that further.  A likely
contributor to that is that pbrt-v3 doesn’t compute ray differentials for
indirect rays in the path tracer; in turn, those rays will always access
the most detailed texture MIP level, which is not very friendly to texture
caching.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-wrt-pbrt-v3">Conclusion (w.r.t. pbrt-v3)</h2>

<p>After fixing up graphics state management, I hit the point where it wasn’t
obvious how to make further progress without making substantial changes to
the system; nothing was left that both took a lot of time and hadn’t yet
seen attention for optimization.  Therefore, we’ll stop here, at least as
far as pbrt-v3 goes.</p>

<p>Overall, it was good progress: from 35 minutes to 12m 20s of startup time
before rendering, a 2.83x speedup overall.  Further, memory use was reduced
from 80 GB to 69 GB by being smarter about the transformation cache. All of
that is available now if you sync to the latest version of pbrt-v3 (or if
you have done so in the past few months.)  And we’ve come to understand
what a mess <code class="highlighter-rouge">Primitive</code> memory is for this scene; we figured out how to
save another 18 GB of memory, though didn’t implement that in pbrt-v3.</p>

<p>Here is where those 12m 20s at startup is spent after all of these
optimizations:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Multi-threading more of the startup phase would probably be the best option
to improve performance from there: almost everything during scene parsing
is single-threaded; BVH construction is a natural candidate. It also might
be interesting to peel off things like PLY file reading and BVH generation
for individual object instances and run them asynchronously in the
background while allowing parsing to proceed in the main thread.</p>

<p>At some point I’ll look into whether there are faster <code class="highlighter-rouge">strtof()</code>
implementations; pbrt just uses whatever the system provides.  I am wary
about replacing that with something that’s not super well tested, however;
parsing floats is one of those things that you really want to trust
will always just work so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Further reducing the load on the parser is also appealing: we still have 17
GB of text input files to parse.  We could support a binary encoding of
pbrt input files (possibly along the lines of <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/resources/RenderMan_20/ribBinding.html#binary-encoding">RenderMan’s
approach</a>),
though I have mixed feelings about the idea; being able to open up scene
description files in a text editor and edit away is quite useful, and I
worry that sometimes using a binary encoding would end up being confusing
to students using pbrt in classes.  This is probably one of those places
where the right decision for pbrt is probably different than the right
decision for an industrial-grade commercial renderer.</p>

<p>It was a fun adventure to chase down all of these optimizations and to
better understand how various design decisions in pbrt turned out to have
unexpected implications with a scene of this complexity.  All this is a
great example of how useful it is to have a true production-complexity
scene available to the general rendering community; huge thanks again to
Disney for taking the time to put this scene together and make it available
to everyone.</p>

<p>For our <a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/15/moana-island-pbrt-4.html">next installment</a>, we’ll look at a few things that
further improve performance if we allow more radical changes to pbrt.</p>
