  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have a branch of pbrt that I use for trying out new ideas, implementing
neat things from papers, and generally exploring things that end up in a
future edition of <em>Physically Based Rendering</em>.  Unlike
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3">pbrt-v3</a>, which we try to keep as close as
possible to the system described in the book, it’s possible to change
anything in that branch.  Today we’ll look at how a few more radical
changes to the system than we’ve considered previously in this series
significantly reduce memory usage with Disney’s <em>Moana</em> island scene.</p>

<p>A note on methodology: in the previous three posts, all of the statistics
were measured with the WIP version of the scene I was working with before
it was released.  For this one, we’ll switch to the final version, which is
slightly more complex.</p>

<p>When rendering the latest <em>Moana</em> island scene,
pbrt-v3 uses 81 GB of RAM to store the scene description.  Today’s
pbrt-next uses 41 GB—about half was much.  A handful of changes totaling
a few hundred lines of code was enough to get us there.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-primitives">Smaller Primitives</h2>

<p>Recall that in pbrt a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Primitive</code> is a combination of a shape, its
material, its emission function (if it’s an area light), and a record of
which participating media are inside and outside its surface.  In pbrt-v3,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">GeometricPrimitive</code>s store:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    std::shared_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; shape;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;Material&gt; material;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;AreaLight&gt; areaLight;
    MediumInterface mediumInterface;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As <a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/09/moana-island-pbrt-2.html#primitive-woes">discussed
earlier</a>,
most of the time, <code class="highlighter-rouge">areaLight</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code>, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MediumInterface</code> holds
a pair of <code class="highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code>s.  Therefore, in pbrt-next I added a <code class="highlighter-rouge">SimplePrimitive</code>
variant of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Primitive</code> that only stores pointers to a shape and a material.
It is used in place of <code class="highlighter-rouge">GeometricPrimitive</code> when possible:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class SimplePrimitive : public Primitive {
    // ...
    std::shared_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; shape;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;Material&gt; material;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For non-animated object instances, there’s now <code class="highlighter-rouge">TransformedPrimitive</code>,
which just stores a pointer to a primitive and a transformation, saving the
nearly 500 bytes of <a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/09/moana-island-pbrt-2.html#transformedprimitives-95-wasted-space-really-hurts">unneeded
bloat</a>
that an <code class="highlighter-rouge">AnimatedTransform</code> instance added to pbrt-v3’s
<code class="highlighter-rouge">TransformedPrimitive</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class TransformedPrimitive : public Primitive {
    // ...
    std::shared_ptr&lt;Primitive&gt; primitive;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;Transform&gt; PrimitiveToWorld;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(pbrt-next has an <code class="highlighter-rouge">AnimatedPrimitive</code> for the case where an animated
transformation is actually needed.)</p>

<p>With these changes, the statistics report 7.8 GB used for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Primitive</code>s,
down from 28.9 GB in pbrt-v3. Lovely as it is to save 21 GB, that’s not as
much of a reduction as we’d have expected from the back of the envelope
estimate earlier; we’ll come back to that discrepancy at the end of this
post.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-shapes">Smaller Shapes</h2>

<p>Memory used for geometry is also significantly reduced in pbrt-next: space
used for triangle meshes is down from 19.4 GB to 9.9 GB and space used for
curves is down from 1.4 GB to 1.1 GB.  A little more than half of this
savings comes from a simplification of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> base class.</p>

<p>In pbrt-v3, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> brings with it a few members that all <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>
implementations carry along—these are just a few things that are handy to
have access to in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> implementations.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Shape {
    // ....
    const Transform *ObjectToWorld, *WorldToObject;
    const bool reverseOrientation;
    const bool transformSwapsHandedness;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To understand why those member variables are problematic, it’s helpful to
understand how triangle meshes are represented in pbrt.  First, there’s a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">TriangleMesh</code> class, which stores the vertex and index buffers for an
entire mesh:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct TriangleMesh {
    int nTriangles, nVertices;
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vertexIndices;
    std::unique_ptr&lt;Point3f[]&gt; p;
    std::unique_ptr&lt;Normal3f[]&gt; n;
    // ...
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Each triangle in the mesh is represented by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triangle</code>, which inherits
from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>.  The idea is to keep <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triangle</code>s as small as
possible: they only store a pointer to the mesh that they’re a
part of and a pointer to the offset in the index buffer where their vertex
indices start:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Triangle : public Shape {
    // ...
    std::shared_ptr&lt;TriangleMesh&gt; mesh;
    const int *v;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triangle</code> implementation needs to find the positions of its
vertices or the like, it does the appropriate indexing to get them from the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">TriangleMesh</code>.</p>

<p>The problem with pbrt-v3’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> is that the values it stores are the same for
all of the triangles in a mesh, so it’d be better to just store them once for
each entire mesh in <code class="highlighter-rouge">TriangleMesh</code> and then to allow <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triangle</code>s to access
a single copy of the shared values when needed.</p>

<p>That’s fixed in pbrt-next: the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> base class in pbrt-next doesn’t have
those members and as such, each and every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triangle</code> is 24 bytes smaller.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Curve</code> shape follows a similar strategy and also benefits from a
leaner <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>.</p>

<h2 id="shared-triangle-buffers">Shared triangle buffers</h2>

<p>Although the <em>Moana</em> island scene makes extensive use of object instancing
for explicitly replicated geometry, I wondered how much reuse there might
happen to be across things like index buffers, texture coordinate buffers,
and so forth across separate triangle meshes.</p>

<p>I wrote a little class that hashes those buffers as they come in and stores
them in a cache.  I modified <code class="highlighter-rouge">TriangleMesh</code> to check the cache and
use the already stored version of any redundant buffer that it needed.
There was a nice benefit: 4.7 GB of redundant storage was eliminated, which
was much more than I expected.</p>

<h2 id="the-stdshared_ptr-disaster">The std::shared_ptr disaster</h2>

<p>With the changes so far, the statistics reported about 36 GB of known
memory allocations, while at the start of rendering, <code class="highlighter-rouge">top</code> reported 53 GB
used.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I was dreading another series of slow <code class="highlighter-rouge">massif</code> runs to figure out which
allocations the statistics were missing when an email from <a href="https://zeuxcg.org/">Arseny
Kapoulkine</a> appeared in my inbox.  Arseny explained to
me that <a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/09/moana-island-pbrt-2.html#geometricprimitive-50-wasted-space-hurts">my earlier estimates of <code class="highlighter-rouge">GeometricPrimitive</code> memory
use</a>
were significantly off.  It took a few back and forths before I fully
understood; many thanks to Arseny for pointing the issue out and for
explaining until I understood.</p>

<p>Before Arseny’s email, my mental model of how <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::shared_ptr</code>s were
implemented was that there was a shared descriptor that stored a reference
count and the pointer to the actual allocated object, along the lines of:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; class shared_ptr_info {
    std::atomic&lt;int&gt; refCount;
    T *ptr;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then I assumed that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">shared_ptr</code> instance would just point to and use
that:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; class shared_ptr {
    // ...
    T *operator-&gt;() { return info-&gt;ptr; }
    shared_ptr_info&lt;T&gt; *info;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In short, I assumed that <code class="highlighter-rouge">sizeof(shared_ptr&lt;&gt;)</code> is the same as the size of
a pointer, and I assumed that there was about 16 bytes of additional
overhead for each shared pointer.</p>

<p>That is not so.</p>

<p>In the implementation on my system here, the shared descriptor is 32
bytes, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">sizeof(shared_ptr&lt;&gt;)</code> is 16 bytes. As such, a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">GeometricPrimitive</code> that’s mostly <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::shared_ptr</code>s is about twice as big
as I’d estimated.  If you’re curious about the whys, these two Stack
Overflow postings nicely explain the details: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9201435">1</a>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34046853">2</a>.</p>

<p>Almost all of my uses of <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::shared_ptr</code> in pbrt-next didn’t need to be
shared pointers. In a day’s frenzy of hacking, I replaced as many as I
could with <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::unique_ptr</code>, which is indeed the same size as a regular
pointer.  For example, here’s what <code class="highlighter-rouge">SimplePrimitive</code> looks like now:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class SimplePrimitive : public Primitive {
    // ...
    std::unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; shape;
    const Material *material;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The payoff was better than I’d hoped for: memory use at the start of
rendering dropped from 53 GB to 41 GB—a 12 GB savings, totally unexpected
just a few days ago, and down to basically half of what pbrt-v3 uses.
Woop!</p>

<p><a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/16/moana-island-pbrt-5.html">Next time</a>, we’ll finally wrap up this series with a look at rendering
performance with pbrt-next and discuss a few ideas about additional things
to look into for reducing memory use with this scene.</p>
