    <p>There are two perspectives that one might take in assessing how far things
have come with pbrt-v4’s performance with <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/resources/moana-island-scene/">Disney’s Moana Island
scene</a>: the
optimist’s and the pessimist’s.  As far as rendering performance goes, I
can’t find much to be pessimistic about.  The GPU especially has done well
on that front, to the point that time spent parsing the scene description
and preparing data structures for rendering—time to first pixel—is a
significant contributor to overall performance when it is used.</p>

<p>About time to first pixel: here is the optimist’s view, which looks at
progress measured with respect to where we started.</p>

<p>From that perspective, it’s been a smashing success, bringing a heavy scene
from something that is nearly intolerable to render to something that has a
bit of a hitch getting started, no big deal for what you get in return.</p>

<p>For an alternative viewpoint, here is the graph of pbrt’s CPU utilization
over those 59.6 seconds up until the start of rendering, with all of those
improvements in there and measured with 64 threads on a 32-core AMD
3970X CPU. As before, the x axis is measured in seconds, a value of 1 on
the y axis represents all 64 threads running, and the time at which
rendering starts is indicated with a vertical dashed line.  Unlike the last
two posts, this graph starts from the very beginning, so parsing and
related work is back in there again.</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="/matt/blog/images/ttfp-cpu-fin-64.svg" alt="CPU utilization (64 threads, starting point)" /> </p>

<p>After what seemed like good progress from addressing post-parsing
bottlenecks, it’s disheartening to see how bad the complete graph
is—there’s still an enormous amount of space above the line, all of it
wasted potential.  Therefore, today it’ll be one more go at improving
parallelism and reducing time to first pixel.</p>

<p>Before getting to work, let’s distract ourselves with an image.  Here’s the
beach view, again at 256 samples per pixel, rendered on both the CPU and
the GPU. My hacky <a href="/matt/blog/2021/07/29/moana-rendered-on-the-gpu.html#preliminaries-textures-and-curves">GPU Ptex
implementation</a>
fares better here than in the roots view, though there are still issues on
the sand dunes and the tree trunks.</p>

<div class="card-img-top" style="display:block; width: 100%; padding-top: 47%;  position:relative;">
<div id="beachview" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;"></div></div>
<script>
Jeri.renderViewer(document.getElementById('beachview'), {
  title: 'beachview', children: [
 { title: 'CPU', image: '/matt/blog/images/moana-beach-cpu-256spp.exr' },
 { title: 'GPU', image: '/matt/blog/images/moana-beach-gpu-256spp.exr' }
 ]});
</script>

<p><br /></p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/b6a3f681108d5ebd414b0aa0a5d4ba4c99eca8e4">the version of pbrt that is today’s starting
point</a>,
the RTX A6000 GPU renders its image in 36.3 seconds, taking a total of 105
seconds of wall-clock time including parsing the scene and setting up the
data structures.  The 32 core AMD 3970X takes 928 seconds to render it, or
1033 seconds including everything.  Rendering is slightly over 25x faster
with the GPU.</p>

<h2 id="speed-of-light">Speed of Light?</h2>

<p>That graph made it clear that time to first pixel could be better. But how
much better?  The area under the graph represents the amount of CPU work
that is done over the course of getting started and summing it up gives us
the total amount of CPU work required.</p>

<p>It’s easy enough to modify pbrt’s logging code to track the total CPU
utilization, from which we can learn that it would be 463 seconds of
single-threaded work to get everything up and running.  Thus, in fantasy
perfect parallel scaling world, we would start rendering after 7.2 seconds
on a 32-core/64-thread system as long as the GPU didn’t become the
bottleneck.</p>

<p>Put another way, the 59 second time to first pixel with 64 threads is
slightly more than 8x worse than speed of light performance.  Knowing that
pbrt was still that far off was a painful realization, but it was enough to
motivate giving the code more attention.  So what’s holding it back?</p>

<h2 id="serialization-everywhere">Serialization Everywhere</h2>

<p>A hindrance that comes from pbrt’s design is that we have thus far been
trying to parallelize within distinct phases of computation but never
across them.  It starts reading textures only after parsing is finished; it
starts creating lights only after textures are done; the BVHs for
non-instanced geometry are created before the BVHs for the object
instances, and so forth.  This constraint means that available parallelism
is often limited, making it harder to effectively scale up to use many CPU
cores.</p>

<p>Concretely, within the first milliseconds of the start of parsing the Moana
Island scene, we know that there’s an environment light with its emission
specified by a PNG image; however, the slow (single threaded) reading and
decompression of that PNG doesn’t get started until more than 30 seconds
later when parsing has finished. Then, it’s pretty much the only work
available and all the other threads are unable to do anything useful.  Why
not start sooner and keep an otherwise-idle thread busy while other threads
are processing those few last large scene files?</p>

<p>Honestly, pbrt’s startup phase had mostly been designed without parallelism
in mind; the biggest goal was that it be easily understood by the reader
and that it be simple enough to not use too many pages in the printed book.
Thus, the idea of “first there is a parsing phase”, “now there is a light
creation phase”, and so forth.  However, given the state of CPU utilization
in that earlier graph, I spent a while mulling over whether that design
should be revisited.  I was sure that there was performance to be had from
doing so, but I worried about making the system harder to understand and
debug.  At tension with the goal for pbrt to be understandable is an
aspiration to show best practices and to illustrate more broadly-useful
programming techniques; if that part of the system has really bad parallel
scaling, then that isn’t really best practices, is it?</p>

<p>Something that helped tip the balance was the fact that C++17 has built-in
support for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">futures</a><sup id="fnref:goog"><a href="#fn:goog" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and
has reasonably clean support for asynchronous tasks.  With the building
blocks in the core language, showing what the concepts are good for seemed
like it might be worthwhile in exchange for any added complexity.  And the
beauty of futures is that your thread will just stall if it tries to access
something before it’s ready; there’s not a risk of tricky race conditions.</p>

<p>As I started exploring a redesign of that part of pbrt, I found that C++’s
language built-ins weren’t quite right out of the box: I wanted to run
asynchronous tasks using pbrt’s already-existing thread pool, which isn’t
supported by <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::async</code>.  Fortunately, it was under 30 lines of code to
wrap up an asynchronous job into <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b/src/pbrt/util/parallel.h#L315">something that could run in pbrt’s task
system</a>.
The other thing necessary was a small
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b/src/pbrt/util/parallel.h#L291">wrapper</a>
around <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::future</code> that would call into the job system to do work in the
current thread if a future that was waited on wasn’t ready; that avoided
deadlock, as would have been a problem otherwise with a fixed number of
threads in a thread pool.<sup id="fnref:al"><a href="#fn:al" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="embracing-the-asynchronous-life">Embracing The Asynchronous Life</h2>

<p>With infrastructure that made it easy to kick off asynchronous work, it was
time to start putting it to use.  An easy first step was to
asynchronously create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Media</code> objects that represent participating
media; that doesn’t matter for the Moana Island scene, but it was the
simplest first thing to port over.  <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/117b1c135136633c3701f8bdc5b0c00d02a25f8b">It wasn’t much
code</a>
and, auspiciously, it worked the first time.</p>

<p>Next up: lights, the known troublemaker.  Again, <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/3cdc3a9ef7af0ed61981add9da50909ec2746994">not too much
code</a>,
and more importantly, having written it, I don’t think there’s anything too
complex going on there: as soon as the renderer hears about a light in the
scene, it can kick off a call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">RunAsync()</code> to create it.  It holds on to
a vector of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future&lt;Light&gt;</code>s and then consumes the values returned in the
futures much later—usually well after the time they were actually
created.  That change alone improved time to first pixel with the Moana
Island scene by 5 seconds, which was more than enough encouragement to keep
going.</p>

<p>Textures were next and they weren’t too tricky either, mostly <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/8e1c779f2e1afebf6a630bbc31d038c6bcbe94e4">rearranging
preexisting texture creation
code</a>.
They were good for another few seconds improvement, which brought pbrt to
just over 50 seconds time to first pixel.  Building the top-level
acceleration structures for non-instanced geometry asynchronously while
BVHs for instances were being created was <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/71316edd4e2280c23fad24d71d96aac6846e1f68">another easy
one</a>
and gave another second or so’s improvement on top of that.</p>

<p>Here’s how things look with those changes.  Note that the
“Lights/Textures/Materials” category has disappeared into nothing, with all
of that work already done during parsing and ready by the time it is needed
afterward.  (That work is charged to parsing in the CPU utilization
reported in this graph.  For simplicity, we’ll report CPU utilization by
phases even as we blur the lines between them.)</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="/matt/blog/images/ttfp-cpu-async-multi.svg" alt="CPU utilization (64 threads, asynchronous light, texture, and BVH creation)" /> </p>

<h2 id="mind-the-parser">Mind The Parser</h2>

<p>Eyeballing that graph, we can see that we’re down to just over 10 seconds
of post-parsing work; nearly 40 seconds of parsing time remain, and that’s
where we ought to to look for further improvements.  I realized that I
hadn’t ever profiled pbrt-v4’s parsing and initial scene processing code
with the Moana Island scene; a quick run of
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a> delivered: nearly
20% of parsing time was spent in the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b/src/pbrt/scene.cpp#L405">method that is called to record each
use of an object instance in the
scene</a>.</p>

<p>There are 39 million instances in the scene so that method gets a workout,
but near 20% of total parsing time there seemed high.  Half of that was in
a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::vector::push_back()</code> <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b/src/pbrt/scene.cpp#L427">method
call</a>,
so I looked more closely at what was going on with it.</p>

<p>That <code class="highlighter-rouge">vector</code> is used to record the uses of object instances—for each
one, it needs to store both the name of the object instance being used as
well as a transformation matrix.  Even with 39 million instances, that
still seemed excessive.  I looked at the definition of the object that it
stores, <code class="highlighter-rouge">InstanceSceneEntity</code>.  It was essentially:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct InstanceSceneEntity : public SceneEntity {
    AnimatedTransform *renderFromInstanceAnim = nullptr;
    Transform *renderFromInstance = nullptr;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So you’ve got your instance transformation in one of two flavors and then
whatever we get from <code class="highlighter-rouge">SceneEntity</code>.  What does it have?</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct SceneEntity {
    std::string name;
    FileLoc loc;
    ParameterDictionary parameters;
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code>, which here stores the name of the object instance, there’s
<code class="highlighter-rouge">loc</code>, which stores its location in a scene description file, handy if we
need it for an error message, and then we’ve got ourselves a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ParameterDictionary</code>.</p>

<p>What’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ParameterDictionary</code>? Unnecessary is what it is.  It’s a fairly
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b/src/pbrt/paramdict.h#L97">heavy
structure</a>
that stores user-specified parameters for entities in the scene description
file—e.g., “this sphere has a float-valued parameter, radius, that has a
value of 2.5.”  It isn’t needed at all for object instances—it’s just
weight with lots of extra unused data.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/98cbfcd7993555993fa9d5ba12e8cfeddc792f5c">The
fix</a>
to stop inheriting from <code class="highlighter-rouge">SceneEntity</code> and to store <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">loc</code>
directly in <code class="highlighter-rouge">InstanceSceneEntity</code> changed 6 lines of code.  Time to first
pixel improved by 6 seconds, with the fix apparently contributing to
performance improvements in other places that were copying
<code class="highlighter-rouge">InstanceSceneEntity</code> objects as well.  A bit more time was shaved off in a
follow-on change that <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b">tuned up the hash table used in
TransformCache</a>.
Together those fixes brought pbrt to 44 seconds to first pixel:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="/matt/blog/images/ttfp-cpu-parserwork.svg" alt="CPU utilization (64 threads, with parser improvements)" /> </p>

<h2 id="increasing-imports">Increasing Imports</h2>

<p>That 18 second tail of low CPU utilization at the end of parsing had become
untenable.  Looking at pbrt’s logs, it was easy to see that the “isBeach”
and “isCoral” models were laggards there.  A few
additional uses of the new-ish <a href="/matt/blog/2021/04/11/moana-time-to-first-pixel.html#parsing-in-parallel"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Import</code>
statement</a>
that allows parallel parsing were enough to put more threads working on
those files, which was enough to bring us to 28.7 seconds to first pixel,
now 73 times faster than pbrt-v3 was when <a href="/matt/blog/2018/07/08/moana-island-pbrt-1.html">all this
began</a>.</p>

<p>Put it all together, and here is where things stand with 64 threads:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="/matt/blog/images/ttfp-cpu-64-truefin.svg" alt="CPU utilization (64 threads, with more use of Import)" /> </p>

<p>Here now, I’m happy to stop, even with some potential left above the line.
For the last ten or so seconds the GPU is busy building acceleration
structures, so non-full CPU utilization there is perfectly fine.  I am a
little surprised that the CPU utilization isn’t better at the very start of
parsing, though haven’t dug into that further.</p>

<p>With 4 cores and 8 threads, the news is even better: CPU spends much
of its time at close to full utilization and it’s 53 seconds to first
pixel—better than it was with 32 cores when we started today.  Here is
the CPU utilization graph for that case:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="/matt/blog/images/ttfp-cpu-8-truefin.svg" alt="CPU utilization (8 threads)" /> </p>

<p>(This graph uses the same x axis scale as the other graphs in this
post but here the value 1 on the y axis corresponds to all 8 threads being
busy.)</p>

<p>I was surprised to see pbrt spending a few seconds with low CPU utilization in
“Lights/Textures/Materials” there; presumably that is waiting for the
environment light source’s future, but I’m not sure why that work wouldn’t
have been finished earlier along the way.  I’ll also leave answering that
question for another time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As it usually goes with the Moana Island scene, it’s been quite a journey.
Three years after its release, the complexity it offers continues to be the
best kind of challenging, even after I think I’ve already learned all of my
lessons from it.</p>

<p>Going back to that beach view from earlier in this post: at the start of
this post, it took a total of 105 seconds of wall-clock time to render with
the GPU at 256 samples per pixel from start to finish.  With <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/tree/2e6aace69d877295d33292dffa3239e04546d44b">the version
of pbrt-v4 at the
end</a>,
that’s down to 67 seconds, roughly evenly split between processing the
scene and doing actual rendering—a fine place for wrap up this go-round with
the island scene.</p>
