<p>Work on the text of 4th edition of Physically Based Rendering: From Theory
To Implementation is moving along well.  One important detail to attend to
is to find a scene to use on the cover of the book.</p>

<p>The cover image is an important part of the book.  It has always been
rendered with pbrt, the renderer that the book describes, and so it sums up
the value proposition of reading the book: if you study the book’s text,
you will understand all of the theory and implementation behind rendering
images like this one.</p>

<p>For the second edition, we were very fortunate to have Guillermo M. Leal
Llaguno create the now-classic “San Miguel” scene, and for the third, Timm
Dapper and Jan-Walter Schliep at Laubwerk made a beautifully complex
outdoor landscape scene.  These scenes have become computer graphics
classics, appearing in many subsequent research papers.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are looking for a new scene, or one that has not been widely seen
before.</li>
  <li>It must be rendered by pbrt, though if you have a nice scene in FBX
format, we can help convert it to pbrt’s scene format.</li>
  <li>You must be willing to allow the scene description to be freely shared
once the book has been released so that anyone using pbrt can render it
themselves (e.g., by offering it under a CC-BY license).</li>
  <li>We would prefer an interior scene this time (the last three have all been
outdoors), ideally with multiple interesting viewpoints, a variety of
objects and materials, and complex lighting.</li>
  <li>The more complex the better :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can offer a few things in return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Credit (in the book and on the book’s website, etc.) and our own deepest
thanks.</li>
  <li>A few signed copies of the book.</li>
  <li>The knowledge that most likely, your scene will help advance the state of
the art of rendering; pbrt is widely used by researchers to develop new
algorithms, and putting interesting and challenging scenes in researchers’
hands has turned out to be an effective way to spur innovation.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think you may be able to help or have any questions, please email
Wenzel, Greg, and I at authors@pbrt.org.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
