  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Here we are, a year and a half after I posted an <a href="/matt/blog/2020/04/26/debugging-intro.html">introduction that was
full of talk</a> about a
forthcoming series of blog posts about debugging renderers.  When I posted
that I already had a text file full of notes and had the idea that I’d get
through a series of 8 or so posts over the following few weeks.</p>

<p>…and it’s been nothing but crickets after that setup.</p>

<p>There’s no good reason for my poor follow-through, though this series did
turn into one of those things that got more daunting to return to the
longer time went by; I felt like the bar kept getting higher and that my
eventual postings would have to make up for the bait and switch.</p>

<p>Now that I’m at it again, I can’t promise that these posts will make up for
the wait; in general, you get what you pay for around here.  But let’s
reset and try getting back into it.</p>

<p>To get back in the right mood, here are a pair of images back from the
first time I tried to implement Greg Ward’s irradiance caching algorithm
back when I was in grad school:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/matt/blog/images/irradCacheInfinity.png" width="288" height="192" />
<img src="/matt/blog/images/irradCache.png" width="288" height="192" />
</p>

<p>In the left image (which was rendered from right to left for some reason),
there was a bug that caused energy to grow without bound as the cache was
populated (no doubt a missing factor of \(1/\pi\) that led to a feedback
loop).  I always liked how that image went from ok to a little too bright
to thermonuclear by the time it was halfway through.  The image on the
right is my eventual success, with a slightly different scene layout.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-the-bad-place">Avoiding The Bad Place</h2>

<p>There’s nothing fun about an image that starts out ok and then goes bad or
your renderer crashing after its been running for an hour with a stack
trace 20 levels deep.  There’s lots to be unhappy about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Things are broken, but they’re not utterly broken, which suggests that
the underlying bug will be subtle and thus difficult to track down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s an enormous amount of state to reason about—the scene in all
its complexity, all of the derived data structures, and everything that
happened since the start of rendering until things evidently went wrong.
Any bit of it may hold the problem that led to disaster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More specifically, the actual bug may be in code that ran long before the
bug became evident; some incorrect value computed earlier that messed
things up later, possibly in an indirect way.  This is a particular
challenge with algorithms that reuse earlier results, be it spatially,
temporally or otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be minutes or even hours into rendering before the bug manifests
itself; each time you think you’ve fixed it, you’ve got to again wait
that much longer to confirm that you’re right.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Anything you can do to avoid that sad situation reduces the amount of time
you spend on gnarly debugging problems, and in turn, the more productive
you’ll be (and the more fun you’ll have, actually implementing fun new
things rather than trying to make the old things work correctly.)  That
goal leads to the first principle of renderer debugging:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try to make it a conventional debugging problem (“given these inputs,
this function produces this incorrect output”) and not an unbounded “this
image is wrong and I don’t know why” problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the best ways to have more bugs be in the first category is to
have a good suite of unit tests. There’s nothing glamorous about writing
unit tests, at least in the moment, but they can give you a lot in return
for not too much work.  Not only does failing unit test immediately narrow
down the source of a bug to the few things that the test exercises, but it
generally gives you an easier debugging problem than a failure in the
context of the full renderer.</p>

<h2 id="starting-simple">Starting Simple</h2>

<p>A good unit test is crisp—easy to understand and just testing one thing.
Writing tests becomes more fun if you embrace that way of going about
it—it’s easy coding since the whole goal is to not be tricky, with the
idea that you want to minimize the chance that your test itself has bugs.
A good testing framework helps by making it easy to add tests; I’ve been
using <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">googletest</a> for years, but
there are plenty of others.</p>

<p>It’s good to start out by testing the most obvious things you can think of.
That may be counter-intuitive—it’s tempting to start with devious tests
that poke all the edge cases.  However, if you think about it from the
perspective of encountering a failing test, then the simpler the test is,
the easier it is to reason about the correct behavior, and the easier
debugging will be.  (There is an analogy here to the old joke about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect">drunk searching for his car keys under the street
light</a>.)  Only once the
basics are covered in your tests is it worth getting more clever.  If your
simpler tests pass and only the more complex ones fail, then at least you
can assume that simple stuff is functioning correctly; that may help you
reason about why the harder cases have gone wrong.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a simple one from pbrt-v4. pbrt provides an
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/792aaaa08d97dbedf11a3bb23e246b6443d847b4/src/pbrt/util/parallel.h#L126"><code class="highlighter-rouge">AtomicFloat</code></a>
class that can atomically add values to a floating-point
variable.<sup id="fnref:atomicfloat"><a href="#fn:atomicfloat" class="footnote">1</a></sup> This test ensures that <code class="highlighter-rouge">AtomicFloat</code> isn’t utterly
broken.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>TEST(FloatingPoint, AtomicFloat) {
    AtomicFloat af(0);
    Float f = 0.;
    EXPECT_EQ(f, af);

    af.Add(1.0251);
    f += 1.0251;
    EXPECT_EQ(f, af);

    af.Add(2.);
    f += 2.;
    EXPECT_EQ(f, af);
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The test is as simple as it could be: it performs a few additions and makes
sure that the result is the same as if a regular <code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code> had been used.
It’s hard to imagine that this test would ever fail, but if it
did, jackpot! We have an easy case to reason about and trace through.</p>

<p>Here’s another example of a not-very-clever test from pbrt-v4. Most
of the sampling functions there now provide an inversion function that goes
from sampled values back to the original \([0,1]^n\) sample space.  Thus,
it’s worth checking that a round-trip brings you back to (more or less)
where you started.  The following test takes a bunch of random samples <code class="highlighter-rouge">u</code>,
warps them to directions <code class="highlighter-rouge">dir</code> on the hemisphere, then warps the directions
back to points <code class="highlighter-rouge">up</code> in the canonical \([0,1]^2\) square, before checking
the result is pretty much back where it started.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>TEST(Sampling, InvertUniformHemisphere) {
    for (Point2f u : Uniform2D(1000)) {
        Vector3f dir = SampleUniformHemisphere(u);
        Point2f up = InvertUniformHemisphereSample(dir);

        EXPECT_LT(std::abs(u.x - up.x), 1e-3);
        EXPECT_LT(std::abs(u.y - up.y), 1e-3);
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There’s not much to that test, but it’s a nice one to have in the bag.
Once it passes, you can feel pretty good about your
<code class="highlighter-rouge">InvertUniformHemisphereSample</code> function, at least if you have independent
confidence that <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleUniformHemisphere</code> works.  And how long does it take
to write?  No more than a minute or two.  Once it is passing, you can 
more confidently make improvements to the implementations of either of
those functions knowing that this test has a good chance of failing if you
mess something up.</p>

<p>About succinctness in tests: that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Uniform2D</code> in that test is a <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/792aaaa08d97dbedf11a3bb23e246b6443d847b4/src/pbrt/util/sampling.h#L1075">little
thing</a>
I wrote purely to make unit tests more concise.  It’s crafted to be used
with C++ range-based <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops and here generates 1000 uniformly
distributed 2D sample values to be looped over.  It and a handful of other
sample point generators save a few lines of code in each test that
otherwise needs a number of random values of some dimensionality and
pattern.  I’ve found that just about anything that reduces friction when
writing tests ends up being worthwhile in that each of those things
generally leads to more tests being written in the end.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-of-sampling">The Challenge of Sampling</h2>

<p>One of the challenges in implementing a Monte Carlo renderer is that the
computation is statistical in nature; sometimes it’s hard to tell if a
given sample value is incorrect or if it’s a valid outlier.  Bugs often
only become evident in the aggregate with many samples.  That challenge
extends to writing unit tests—for example, given a routine to draw
samples from some distribution, how can we be sure the samples are in fact
from the expected distribution?</p>

<p>The Right Thing to do is to apply proper statistical tests.  For example,
<a href="http://rgl.epfl.ch/people/wjakob/">Wenzel</a> has written code that applies a
\(\chi^2\)-test to pbrt’s <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/792aaaa08d97dbedf11a3bb23e246b6443d847b4/src/pbrt/bsdfs_test.cpp#L280">BSDF sampling
routines</a>.
Those tests recently helped him chase down and fix <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/commit/dfa1107459745b4d276c9bbdae73941cb269e077">a tricky bug in pbrt’s
rough dielectric sampling
code</a>. Much
respect for doing it the right way.</p>

<p>My discipline is not always as strong as Wenzel’s, though there are some
more straightforward alternatives that are also effective.
For example, pbrt has many little sampling functions that
draw samples from some distribution.  An easy way to test them is to
evaluate the underlying function to create a tabularized distribution and
to confirm that both it and the sampling method to be tested more or less
generate the same samples with same probabilities.  As an example, here is
an excerpt from the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/792aaaa08d97dbedf11a3bb23e246b6443d847b4/src/pbrt/util/sampling_test.cpp#L815">test for sampling a trimmed
Gaussian</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    auto exp = [&amp;](Float x) { return std::exp(-c * x); };
    auto values = Sample1DFunction(exp, 32768, 16, 0, xMax);
    PiecewiseConstant1D distrib(values, 0, xMax);

    for (Float u : Uniform1D(100)) {
        Float sampledX = SampleTrimmedExponential(u, c, xMax);
        Float sampledProb = TrimmedExponentialPDF(sampledX, c, xMax);

        Float discreteProb;
        Float discreteX = distrib.Sample(u, &amp;discreteProb);
        EXPECT_LT(std::abs(sampledX - discreteX), 1e-2);
        EXPECT_LT(std::abs(sampledProb - discreteProb), 1e-2);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sample1DFunction</code> utility routine takes a function and evaluates it in
a specified number of buckets covering a specified range, returning a
vector of values. <code class="highlighter-rouge">PiecewiseConstant1D</code> then computes the corresponding
piecewise-constant 1D distribution.  We then take samples using the exact
sampling routine and the piecewise-constant routine and ensure that each
sample value is approximately the same and each returned sample probability
is close as well.  (This test implicitly depends on both sampling
approaches warping uniform samples to samples from the function with values
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">u</code> close to zero at the lower end of the exponential and <code class="highlighter-rouge">u</code> close to
one at the upper end, which is the case here.)</p>

<p>To be clear: <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleTrimmedExponential</code> could still be buggy even when that
test passes.  One might fret about those fairly large <code class="highlighter-rouge">1e-2</code> epsilons used
for the quality test, for example.  It is possible that the looseness of
those epsilons might mask something subtly wrong, but we can at least trust
that the function isn’t completely broken, off by a significant constant
factor or the like.</p>

<p>Writing this sort of test requires trusting your functions for sampling
tabularized distributions, but those too have their own tests;
eventually one can be confident in all of the foundations.  For example,
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/792aaaa08d97dbedf11a3bb23e246b6443d847b4/src/pbrt/util/sampling_test.cpp#L216">this
one</a>
compares those results to a case where the expected result can be worked
out by hand and ensures that they match.</p>

<h2 id="preserving-the-evidence">Preserving the Evidence</h2>

<p>Another good use for unit tests is for isolating bugs, both for debugging
them when they first occur and for ensuring that a subsequent change to the
system doesn’t inadvertently reintroduce them.</p>

<p>Disney’s <em>Moana Island</em> scene helped surface all sorts of bugs in pbrt;
many were fairly painful to debug since many were of the form of “render
for a few hours before the crash happens.” For those, I found it useful to
turn them into small unit tests as soon as I could narrow down what was
going wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s one for a ray-triangle intersection that went bad.  We have a
degenerate triangle (note that the x and z coordinates are all equal), and
so the intersection test should never return true. But for the specific ray
here, it once did, and then things went south from there.  Trying potential
fixes with a small test like this was a nice way to work through the issue
in the first place—it was easy to try a fix, recompile, and quickly see
if it worked.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>TEST(Triangle, BadCases) {
    Transform identity;
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; indices{ 0, 1, 2 };
    std::vector&lt;Point3f&gt; p { Point3f(-1113.45459, -79.0496140, -56.2431908),
                             Point3f(-1113.45459, -87.0922699, -56.2431908),
                             Point3f(-1113.45459, -79.2090149, -56.2431908) };
    TriangleMesh mesh(identity, false, indices, p, {}, {}, {}, {});
    auto tris = Triangle::CreateTriangles(&amp;mesh, Allocator());

    Ray ray(Point3f(-1081.47925, 99.9999542, 87.7701111),
            Vector3f(-32.1072998, -183.355865, -144.607635), 0.9999);

    EXPECT_FALSE(tris[0].Intersect(ray).has_value());
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>One thing to note when extracting failure cases like this is that it’s
critical to get <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/float-precision-revisited-nine-digit-float-portability/">every last
digit</a>
of floating-point values: if the floats you test with aren’t precisely the
same as the ones that led to the bug, you may not hit the bug at all in a
test run.</p>

<h2 id="never-defer-looking-into-a-failing-test">Never Defer Looking into a Failing Test</h2>

<p>A cautionary tale to wrap up: a few months ago a <a href="Https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/issues/177">bug
report</a> about a failing unit
test in pbrt-v4 came in.  It had the following summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>gcc-8.4 has stuck forever on ZSobolSampler.ValidIndices test</li>
    <li>gcc-9.3 passed all tests</li>
    <li>gcc-10.3 gives me the following message (in an eternal cycle) during tests</li>
  </ul>

  <p><tt>/src/pbrt/samplers_test.cpp:182: Failure</tt><br />
<tt>Value of: returnedIndices.find(index) == returnedIndices.end()</tt><br />
<tt>  Actual: false</tt><br />
<tt>  Expected: true</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ZSobolSampler</code> implements <a href="http://abdallagafar.com/publications/zsampler/">Ahmed and Wonka’s blue noise
sampler</a>, which is based on
permuting a set of low-discrepancy samples in a way that improves their
blue noise characteristics.  pbrt’s <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/792aaaa08d97dbedf11a3bb23e246b6443d847b4/src/pbrt/samplers_test.cpp#L167">ZSobolSampler.ValidIndices
test</a>
essentially just checks that the permutation is correct by verifying that
the same sample isn’t returned for two different pixels.  That test had been
helpful when I first implemented that sampler, but it had been no trouble
for months when that bug report arrived.</p>

<p>When the bug report came in, I took a quick look at that test and couldn’t
imagine how it would ever run forever.  No one else had reported anything
similar and so, to my shame, I assumed it must be a problem with the
compiler installation on the user’s system or some other one-off error.  I
didn’t look at it again for almost two months.</p>

<p>When I gave it more attention, I immediately found that I could reproduce
the bug using those compilers, just as reported.  It was a gnarly bug—one
that disappeared when I recompiled with debugging symbols and even
disappeared with an optimized build with debugging symbols.  The bug would
randomly disappear if I added print statements to log the program’s
execution.  Eventually I thought to try
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">UBSan</a>, and
it saved the day, identifying this line of code as the problem:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>int p = (MixBits(higherDigits ^ (0x55555555 * dimension)) &gt;&gt; 24) % 24;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">0x55555555</code> is a signed integer and multiplying by <code class="highlighter-rouge">dimension</code>, which was
an integer that starts at 0 and goes up from there, quickly led to
overflow, which is undefined behavior (UB) in C++.  In turn, <em>gcc</em> was
presumably assuming that there was no UB in the program and optimizing
accordingly, leading in one case to an infinite loop and in another to a
bogus sample permutation.</p>

<p>At least the fix was easy—all is fine with an unsigned integer, where
overflow is allowed and well-defined:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>int p = (MixBits(higherDigits ^ (0x55555555u * dimension)) &gt;&gt; 24) % 24;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Leaving aside the joys of undefined behavior in C++, it was hard enough to
chase that bug down with it already narrowed down to a failing test.  If
the bug had been something like “images are slightly too dark with
gcc-10.3” (as could conceivably happen with repeated sample values,
depending on how they were being repeated), it surely would have been an
even longer and more painful journey. Score +1 for unit tests and -1 for
me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We’re not done with testing! With the unit testing lecture over, next time
it will be on to some thoughts about writing effective assertions and how
end-to-end tests fit in for testing renderers.</p>
