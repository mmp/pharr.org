    <p>Deterministic program execution has a lot going for it.  For most programs,
it’s the natural way of being: for any particular input, the program
generates the same output.  Determinism makes debugging much easier, as it
saves you from having to re-run the system repeatedly to trigger a bug that
only happens sometimes, and it’s great for end-to-end tests, since you can
safely make strict assertions about cases where the program’s output should
remain absolutely unchanged (e.g., that <a href="/matt/blog/2021/12/19/debugging-renderers-end-to-end-tests.html#when-the-images-should-not-change-at-all">float parser
example</a>).</p>

<p>However, deterministic execution doesn’t always come naturally when you’re
rendering, especially when you’re rendering in parallel.  Today’s post will
go into some of the ways that deterministic execution can be lost, talk
about how to maintain determinism, and then finish with some further
discussion of its benefits.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>To start, let’s settle on a more precise definition of deterministic
rendering than “same input gives same output.”  It is too much to ask for
bit accuracy in output across machines; not only will we encounter
different standard math libraries with different levels of precision, but
there are a number of corners of C++ that allow for things like variation
in <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order">order of
evaluation</a> across
compilers that can lead to innocuous differences in output.</p>

<p>Therefore, we’ll define the observable effect of determinism as: <em>on a
particular system with a particular compiler, repeatedly running the
renderer on the same input always produces the same value at every pixel</em>.
Implicit in that definition is that the same computations are performed to
compute each pixel’s value, though not necessarily in the same order.  That
definition is plenty for our needs; the benefits from nailing it down
further almost certainly wouldn’t be worth the trouble.</p>

<p>A render running on a single core should naturally achieve that goal.  If
it does not, fixing that is the first order of business.  Most likely it’s
an uninitialized memory access, other memory corruption, or code somewhere
that randomly seeds a random number generator based on something that
varies like the process id or current time.  (I won’t say more about fixing
those sorts of problems here, as it’s all rendering-independent and is
regular everyday debugging.)</p>

<p>Rendering in parallel is when things get more complicated.  Indeed, none of
the versions of pbrt before the latest,
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4">pbrt-v4</a>, was deterministic.  That was
always a minor annoyance when debugging and testing the system, though I
honestly didn’t realize what a productivity drag it was until determinism
was achieved.</p>

<h2 id="consistent-samples">Consistent Samples</h2>

<p>For rendering to be deterministic, the Monte Carlo sampling routines must
use exactly the same random sample points at every sample taken in every
pixel.  If they are not, then determinism is lost from the start, since
different rays will be traced each time due to slightly different rays
leaving the camera, different sampling decisions will be made at
intersections, and so forth.  One might assume that deterministic is the
natural way of being for the
<a href="https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Sampling_and_Reconstruction/Sampling_Interface#BasicSamplerInterface">Sampler</a>s
that generate those points, but that was not so prior to pbrt-v4.  There
were two issues: the placement of low discrepancy point sets and carried
state in samplers that led to nondeterminism with multithreading.</p>

<p>When using low discrepancy point sets like Halton points, pbrt-v3 aligns
the origin of the points with the upper left pixel of the image.  That’s
normally \((0,0)\), but then if the user specifies a crop window to
render just part of the image the low discrepancy points all shift in
compensation.  That was always a bother for debugging since you couldn’t
narrow in on a problem pixel without perturbing all of the samples and
often no longer hitting the bug.  That detail was easy enough to fix given
attention to it.</p>

<p>The other issue came from the fact that each thread maintains its own
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Sampler</code> instance.  This way samplers can maintain state that depends on
the current pixel and pixel sample (e.g., an offset into the Halton
sequence).  Many samplers also use pseudorandom number generators (RNGs) in
their work; those, too, are per-sampler state.  (For example, the
stratified sampler uses a RNG to jitter sample locations and low
discrepancy samplers use RNGs for randomization via scrambling.)</p>

<p>In pbrt-v3, those per-sampler RNGs are seeded once at system startup time
and then chug along, generating random numbers as requested.  Because
threads are dynamically assigned to work on regions of the image, they may
not work on the same pixels over multiple runs.  In turn, the values that a
RNG returns at a pixel both depends on which thread was assigned that pixel
as well as how many random numbers it had supplied previously for other
pixels.</p>

<p>The fix was easy: reseed the RNG before generating sample points at a
particular pixel sample.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sampler</code> interface includes a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">StartPixelSample()</code> method that is called before samples are requested at
a given pixel sample, so it’s just a few lines of code to put those RNGs in
a known state.  Here’s that method in <code class="highlighter-rouge">IndependentSampler</code>, which generates
uniform independent samples without any further nuance:</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">StartPixelSample</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Point2i</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">sampleIndex</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">dimension</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">rng</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SetSequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seed</span><span class="p">));</span>
    <span class="n">rng</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Advance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sampleIndex</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">65536ull</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">dimension</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are two things to note in <code class="highlighter-rouge">StartPixelSample()</code>’s implementation.
First, pbrt uses the <a href="https://www.pcg-random.org/index.html">PCG</a> RNG,
which allows the specification of both a particular sequence of
pseudorandom values as well as an offset into that sequence.  Thus, we
choose a sequence according to the pixel coordinates and then offset into
it according to the index of the sample being taken in the pixel.</p>

<p>The other thing to mention there is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hash()</code>, which has been useful all
over the place in pbrt-v4.  Here is its signature:</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">Args</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">Hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Args</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can pass a bunch of values or objects straight away to it and it
marshals them up and passes them to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash">MurmurHash</a> to hash
them.<sup id="fnref:padding"><a href="#fn:padding" class="footnote">1</a></sup> In its use in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">IndependentSampler</code>, we also allow the
user to specify a seed for random number generation; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hash()</code> makes
it simple to mush that together with the current pixel coordinates to
choose a pseudorandom sequence for the current pixel.</p>

<p>There is, needless to say, a short <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/64c0a5cc0b29d6c6ffdacc53f93bc714e047e3b0/src/pbrt/samplers_test.cpp#L15">unit
test</a>
that ensures all of the samplers consistently generate the same sample values.</p>

<h2 id="other-moments-of-randomness">Other Moments of Randomness</h2>

<p>Samplers were much of the trouble in bringing pbrt-v4 into the land of
deterministic output, though two other places in the system that made
random decisions without the involvement of a sampler needed attention.</p>

<p>First was a <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/64c0a5cc0b29d6c6ffdacc53f93bc714e047e3b0/src/pbrt/cpu/primitive.cpp#L57">stochastic alpha
test</a>,
deep in the primitive intersection code.  For shapes that have an alpha
texture assigned to them, we’d like to ignore any intersections where the
alpha texture is zero and randomly accept ones with fractional alpha with
probability according to their alpha value.  The sampler isn’t available in
the ray intersection routines and keeping a persistent RNG in that code has
obvious problems, so here is what we do instead:</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Float</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Evaluate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">si</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">intr</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Possibly ignore intersection based on stochastic alpha test
</span>    <span class="n">Float</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">HashFloat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// Ignore this intersection and trace a new ray
</span>        <span class="p">[...]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Given a less-than-one alpha value, a call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">HashFloat()</code> gives a uniform
random floating-point value between 0 and 1.  It’s a buddy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hash()</code> and
is also happy to take whichever-all values you pass it to turn into a
random floating-point value.  (Above, it’s the ray origin and direction.)</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">Args</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="n">Float</span> <span class="n">HashFloat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Args</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kt">uint32_t</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">...))</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mh">0x1</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Thus, the results are deterministic for any given ray.</p>

<p>The second case was in pbrt-v4’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">LayeredBxDF</code> class, which implements <a href="https://shuangz.com/projects/layered-sa18/">Guo
et al.’s algorithm</a> for
stochastic evaluation and sampling of the BRDFs of layered materials.  That
needs an unbounded number of independent random samples, so we instantiate
an RNG for each evaluation, but <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/64c0a5cc0b29d6c6ffdacc53f93bc714e047e3b0/src/pbrt/bxdfs.h#L513">seed it via the incident and outgoing
directions</a>.
Thus again, for any pair of directions passed to the BRDF evaluation
method, the same set of random samples will be generated and the returned
value will be deterministic.</p>

<h2 id="consistent-pixel-sums">Consistent Pixel Sums</h2>

<p>With what we have so far, the same rays will be traced each
time the renderer runs and in turn, if an assertion fires along the
way, it will do so consistently.  That’s a big benefit for debugging, but
we have not yet achieved deterministic output, which is important for
making end-to-end tests maximally useful.</p>

<p>The remaining challenge lies in summing sample values to compute each
pixel’s final value. Because floating-point addition is not associative, if
the image samples that contribute to a pixel are not accumulated carefully
the order of summation may be different across different runs of the
program and so the output may change.  That was a problem in pbrt-v3 due to
how it computed final pixel values: there, the image is decomposed into
rectangular regions that are assigned to threads and threads generate samples
within their regions, updating the pixels that each sample contributes to.</p>

<p>This figure illustrates the problem with that, showing all of the samples
that contribute to a particular output pixel (black dot):</p>

<p><img src="/matt/blog/images/thread pixel sampling.svg" height="400" /></p>

<p>We have two threads responsible for adjacent \(4 \times 4\) pixel regions of the
image (thick boxes).  For an output image pixel near the boundary of the
two regions that has a reconstruction filter that is wider than the pixel
spacing (shaded circle), some of the samples that contribute will be taken
by thread 1 (orange dots) and some will come from samples taken by thread 2
(blue dot).  Because the threads are independent, the filtered sample
values are not accumulated in a deterministic order and thus, the final
pixel value is not deterministic.</p>

<p>pbrt-v4 addresses this issue by adopting Ernst et al.’s <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.183.3579&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">filter importance
sampling</a>
approach.  Independent samples are taken for each output pixel, with no
sample sharing with other pixels.  If only a single thread works on a pixel
at a time, then the samples for each output pixel are naturally generated
in a consistent order, giving a consistent sum.  (Filter importance
sampling has a number of additional advantages that are detailed in the
paper, including better preservation of the benefits of high-quality
sampling patterns.)  With that tuned up, we (almost) have deterministic
output.</p>

<h2 id="those-pesky-splats">Those Pesky Splats</h2>

<p>One more thing… pbrt-v4’s output is not quite deterministic if a light
transport algorithm that traces paths starting from the light sources is
being used.  In that case, light path vertices are splatted into the image
at whichever pixel they are visible; if multiple threads end up splatting
into the same pixel, then we are back to nondeterminism from unordered
floating-point addition.</p>

<p>This issue could be addressed by having each thread splat into its own
image and then summing the images at the end, though that would incur a
cost in memory use that scales with the number of threads.  Alternatively,
we might use fixed-point rather than floating-point to store those pixel
values.  For now that issue is unaddressed; it rarely causes any trouble,
especially since those splatted values are accumulated in double precision
and generally converted all the way down to half-float precision for
storage.  Most of the time that loss of precision hides any sloppy sums.</p>

<h2 id="the-joys-of---debugstart">The Joys of --debugstart</h2>

<p>The greatest benefit of deterministic rendering has been the ability to
quickly iterate on bugs: you can add some logging code or more assertions,
recompile, and re-render, confident that the new code will see the same
inputs as triggered the bug.  Samplers that give exactly the same
samples at each pixel also means that you can speed things up by just
rendering a crop window or even a single pixel as you’re chasing a bug.</p>

<p>Even better, it was easy to go even further and add support for retracing
just a single offending ray path.  pbrt-v4 has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">CheckCallbackScope</code> class
that uses RAII to register a callback function that will run if an
assertion fails or if the renderer crashes.  Here is how it is used in most
of pbrt’s CPU integrators:</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">thread_local</span> <span class="n">Point2i</span> <span class="n">threadPixel</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">thread_local</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">threadSampleIndex</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">CheckCallbackScope</span> <span class="nf">_</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">]()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">StringPrintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Rendering failed at pixel (%d, %d) sample %d. Debug with "</span>
                        <span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s">--debugstart %d,%d,%d</span><span class="se">\"\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
                        <span class="n">threadPixel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threadPixel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threadSampleIndex</span><span class="p">,</span>
                        <span class="n">threadPixel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threadPixel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threadSampleIndex</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As rendering proceeds, each thread keeps its thread-local <code class="highlighter-rouge">threadPixel</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">threadSampleIndex</code> variables up to date and if the renderer aborts due to
an error, you get a message like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Rendering failed at pixel (915, 249) sample 83. Debug with "--debugstart 915,249,83"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>at the bottom of the crash output.  If you then rerun pbrt passing it that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">--debugstart</code> option, a <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/blob/64c0a5cc0b29d6c6ffdacc53f93bc714e047e3b0/src/pbrt/cpu/integrators.cpp#L68">specialized code
path</a>
traces just that single ray path in the main thread of execution.  That
gives a simpler debugging context than launching a bunch of threads and
waiting for the bug to hit again; it’s delightfully helpful for bugs that
otherwise only happen after a substantial amount of time has gone by.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We’ve made it past “detecting rendering bugs” and have made our way to
“reliably replicating those bugs.”  Next time will be a few thoughts about
performance bugs before we get into actual debugging techniques.</p>
